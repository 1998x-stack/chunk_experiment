<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">With the growing scale and complexity of high-performance computing (HPC) systems, resilience solutions that ensure continuity of service despite frequent errors and component failures must be methodically designed to balance the reliability requirements with the overheads to performance and power.
Design patterns enable a structured approach to the development of resilience solutions, providing hardware and software designers with the building block elements for the rapid development of novel solutions and for adapting existing technologies for emerging, extreme-scale HPC environments.
In this paper, we develop analytical models that enable designers to evaluate the reliability and performance characteristics of the design patterns. These models are particularly useful in building a unified framework that analyzes and compares various resilience solutions built using a combination of patterns.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many of the choices that drive hardware and software component designs in emerging extreme-scale high-performance computing (HPC) systems are made to deliver maximum application performance, but are also subject to the constraints of cost, power and reliability. While HPC system architectures have evolved significantly over the past decade, these constraints are expected to force further dramatic changes to the system stack to achieve exascale performance.
Recent system architectures have emphasized increasing on-chip and node-level parallelism in addition to complex memory architectures consisting of deeper hierarchies and diverse technologies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. The software infrastructure, including the system software, middleware and tools, has continued to evolve to keep up with these changes to the system architectures to drive application performance on these extreme-scale computers.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The reliability and availability of the recent generation of HPC systems have been degrading in comparison to their predecessors <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. This trend is projected to cause future extreme-scale systems to experience unprecedented rates of faults, which will make it difficult to accomplish productive work. The increasingly complex, multicomponent hardware and software environment only makes the challenge of detection of faults in a timely manner, containment of error propagation and mitigation of the impact of error and failure events more difficult.
Resilience solutions must protect the correctness of HPC applications in the presence of faults, errors and failures arising from a multitude of sources, including the system environment, the interactions between platform hardware and system software components and applications, and variability in behavior of hardware components, while seeking to limit the performance and power overhead they impose on the system.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">To navigate the complexities of this emerging landscape of HPC design, we proposed a structured approach to designing HPC resilience solutions based on the concept of design patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. In general, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in any design discipline. A pattern provides a description or template for how to solve a problem that may be adapted to specific context. Resilience patterns describe solutions to confront faults and their consequences. The patterns describe techniques for detection, containment and mitigation of faults, errors and failure events. They can be instantiated at any layer of the system stack. The resilience design patterns serve as building block elements for designing complete solutions, and are useful for the exploration of design alternatives for a target HPC system environment and application workload. Section <a href="#S2" title="2 Background: Resilience Design Patterns ‣ Pattern-based Modeling of High-Performance Computing Resilience" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> describes the concept of patterns and summarizes the different types of resilience patterns that are organized in a catalog.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The development of resilience solutions through composition of various design patterns lends structure to the design and implementation process by compelling designers to consider the key issues of protection coverage, fault model, handling capability, etc. However, objectively selecting pattern solutions that have been examined and utilized successfully in a specific context with the intention of adapting them to a new architecture or software environment of a future system requires criteria based on a quantitative foundation.
Mathematical models of hardware or software components, or even entire HPC systems, which are solved either analytically or through discrete event simulation, are useful to HPC designers for predicting resilient behavior of the system in the presence of various fault, error and failure events, without having to build the component or system.
This paper develops models for analytical evaluation of reliability and performance measures of the various resilience design patterns in our pattern catalog. These models are presented in Section <a href="#S3" title="3 Reliability and Performance Models for Resilience Design Patterns ‣ Pattern-based Modeling of High-Performance Computing Resilience" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>.
The models are designed to capture the interaction between the resilient behavior and the performance overhead incurred by instantiating a specific pattern.
Section <a href="#S4" title="4 Model-based Evaluation of Resilience ‣ Pattern-based Modeling of High-Performance Computing Resilience" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> discusses approaches to calculate reliability and performance of a solution built by combining several patterns.</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Design patterns identify the key aspects of a solution to common problem, and presents the solution in the form of an abstract description, which provides designers with guidelines on how to address the problem. Patterns capture the best-known techniques to solve a problem. We developed resilience design patterns <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> to support a systematic approach to designing and implementing new resilience solutions and adapting existing solutions to future extreme-scale architectures and software environments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The patterns describe the design decisions and trade-offs that must be considered when applying a pattern solution to a specific context. The descriptions encourage designers to reason about the impact of applying a solution on a system’s performance scalability and power consumption overhead as well as consider implementation issues. Based on the patterns, we developed a framework that enables designers to comprehensively evaluate the scope of protection domain and the handling efficiency of resilience solutions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The basic template of a resilience design pattern is defined in an event-driven paradigm, in which each resilience design pattern consists of a <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">behavior</span> and a set of <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">activation</span> and <span id="S2.SS1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">response interfaces</span>. The patterns present solutions to specific problems in detecting, recovering from, or masking a fault, error or failure event. The pattern descriptions are abstract and they may be implemented by HPC applications’ algorithms, numerical libraries, system software, or even in the hardware architectures. We have organized the resilience design pattern as a catalog that contains detailed descriptions of the patterns. The catalog is available as a specification document <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, in which each resilience pattern is presented using a structured format to enable designers to quickly discover whether the pattern solution is suitable to the problem being solved.</p>

<div id="S2.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We developed a pattern classification scheme that organizes the resilience patterns in a layered hierarchy, in which each level addresses a specific aspect of the problem. The classification enables designers to separately reason about the patterns that define the scope of the protection domain and those that define the semantics of the detection, containment and mitigation. The hierarchical organization of the patterns permits system architects to work on the overall organization of the solutions by analyzing the integration of various resilience patterns across the system stack while designers of individual hardware and software components can focus on implementation of the patterns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Resilience in the context of HPC systems and its applications has two key dimensions: (1) forward progress of the system; (2) data consistency in the system. Based on these factors, we organize the resilience design patterns into two major categories, <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">state</span> patterns and <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">behavioral</span> patterns.
The behavioral patterns identify detection, containment, or mitigation actions that enable a system to cope with the presence of a fault, error, or failure event. These patterns are organized hierarchically and they include <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">strategy</span>, <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">architectural</span> and <span id="S2.SS2.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">structural</span> patterns.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The strategy patterns define high-level polices of a resilience solution. Their descriptions are deliberately abstract to enable hardware and software architects to reason about the overall organization of the techniques used and their implications on the full system design. These patterns describe the overall structure of the solution and the key attributes of the solution and their capabilities independent of the layer of system stack and hardware/software architectural features. The architectural patterns convey specific methods necessary for the construction of a resilience solution. They explicitly convey the type of fault, error or failure event that they handle and provide detail about the key components and connectors that make up the solution. The structural patterns provide concrete descriptions of the solution rather than high-level strategies. They comprise of instructions that may be implemented in hardware/software components. While the strategy and architectural patterns serve to provide designers with a clear overall framework of a solution and the type of events that it can handle, the structural patterns express the details so they can contribute to the development of complete working solutions.</p>

<div id="S2.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Each pattern in the resilience design pattern catalog presents a solution to a specific problem in detecting, containing or mitigating a fault, error or failure event. In order to construct complete resilience solutions designers must identify patterns that provide each of these capabilities and apply them to a well-defined protection domain. Therefore, a complete solution consists of at least one state pattern (defining scope
of the protection domain), and one or more behavioral patterns (supporting a combination of
detection, containment and mitigation solutions).</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For hardware and software designers to make practical use these patterns in the development of resilient versions of their designs, we have developed a design framework that a set of guidelines are necessary to combine the patterns and refine their implementations. The framework is based on design spaces that are arranged
in a hierarchy. By working through the design spaces, designers can convert initial outline of the resilience solution into a concrete implementation by considering the layer of abstraction for the pattern implementation, scalability of the solution, portability to other architectures, dependencies on any hardware/software features, flexibility to adapt the solution to accelerated fault rates, capability to handle other types of fault and error events, the performance and performance overheads.</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The models are intended to be useful for predicting the reliability and performance characteristics of solutions built using design patterns in a notional extreme-scale system that may use different plausible architectures and configurations that consist of different node counts, and may use different software environments.
Therefore, we present the analytic models for the various architecture patterns in our catalog because these patterns explicitly specify the type of event that they handle and convey details about the handling capabilities and the components that make up the solution in a manner independent of the layer of system stack and hardware/software architectural features. For the checkpoint and rollback pattern, we present models for the derivative structural patterns due to their widespread use in HPC environments. The models for the patterns provide a quantitative analysis of the costs and benefits of instantiating specific resilience design patterns. The models may be applied to an individual hardware or software component, which is a sub-system, or to a full system that consists of a collection of nodes capable of running a parallel application.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Although the future extreme-scale systems may not look at all like the systems of today, we assume that the notional system consists of multiple processing nodes, and that the parallel application partitions the work among tasks that run on these nodes that cooperate via message passing to synchronize. Therefore, we use the following notation in the descriptions of the models: <span id="S3.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">N</span>: number of tasks/processes in the parallel application; <span id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">M</span>: total number of messages exchanged between the tasks/processes of the application; <span id="S3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">P</span>: the number of processors in the system; <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">T<sub id="S3.p2.1.1.1" class="ltx_sub">system</sub></span>: the operation time of the system, or the execution time of an application.</p>

<p id="S3.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The fault diagnosis pattern identifies the presence of the fault and tries to determine its root cause.
Until a fault has not activated into an error it does not affect the correct operation of the system, and therefore the pattern makes an assessment about the presence of a defect based on observed behavior of one or more system parameters. To incorporate this pattern in an HPC environment requires inclusion of a monitoring component. The pattern uses either effect-cause or cause-effect analysis on the observed parameters of a monitored system to infer the presence of a fault. The performance overhead of this pattern may be expressed as:</p>

Upon detection of an error or a failure, the checkpoints/logged events are used to recreate last known error- or failure-free state of the system, after which the system operation is restarted. The rollback recovery pattern is a derivative of the checkpoint-recovery provides rollback recovery, i.e., based on a temporal view of the system’s progress, the system state recreated during the recovery process is a previous correct version of the state of the system.</p>

<p id="S3.SS5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The redundancy pattern is based on a strategy of compensation since it entails creation of a group of N replicas of a system. The replicated versions of the system are used in various configurations to compensate for errors or failures in one of the system replicas, including fail-over, active comparison for error detection, or majority voting for detection and correction by excluding the replica whose outputs fall outside the majority. The use of the redundancy pattern incurs overhead to the system operation independent of whether an error or failure event occurs.</p>

<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When a design bug exists in a system design or configuration, an error or failure during system operation is often unavoidable. Therefore, the detection and mitigation of the impact of such errors or failures is critical. The n-version design pattern applies distinct implementations of the same design specification created by different individuals or teams. The N versions of the system are operated simultaneously with a majority voting logic is used to compare the results produced by each design version. Due the low likelihood that different individuals or teams make identical errors in their respective implementations, the pattern enables compensating for errors or failures caused by a bug in any one implementation version.</p>

<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">For more intricate analytic evaluation of the performance and reliability, more complex models must be developed. There are several paradigms that are useful for this purpose, including fault trees, block diagrams, reliability &amp; task graphs, Markov &amp; semi-Markov chains, stochastic Petrinets, etc.
Analytical models that use Markov models are useful to model the intricate dependencies between the pattern solutions in a complex multicomponent HPC environment. Markov chains are state-space-based methods that consist of states representing various conditions associated with the system, and the transition between states, which represent the changes in system state or configuration due to the occurrence of a simple or compound event such as the malfunction or failure of one or more components in the system. The assessment of system resilience using Markov models for a multicomponent HPC environment that experiences different modes of faults, as well as a model for the combined evaluation of performance and reliability is the subject of ongoing research.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Much research has been done on modeling techniques and tools that are useful for reliability and performance analysis of various computing systems and applications. These approaches may broadly be categorized into <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>: (i) <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">structural modeling</span>, which highlights the relationships between the system components using representations such as block diagrams, reliability graphs and fault trees. These models assume stochastic independence between system components; (ii) <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">state-space models</span>, which model the dependencies among system components and use representations such as Markov chains. These models are significantly more complex due to the need for as many as 2<sup id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_sup"><span id="S5.p1.1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">n</span></sup> states in the Markov representation for n system components; and, (iii) <span id="S5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">hierarchical models</span>, which balance the speed of analysis with the accuracy of the model by combining abstract structural models with the detailed Markov models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. There have also been several advances in performability analysis, which aim to model the interaction between failure recovery behavior and performance in a composite manner <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Due to the dominance of checkpoint and rollback approaches in high-performance computing systems, several approaches have been proposed for calculating the reliability and performance measures of systems that use this solution.
Analytic models have been developed for determining the optimum intervals for checkpoints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. For applying such analysis to large-scale cluster-based HPC systems, the model has been adapted to meet the goal of minimizing the overall application run time <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. For understanding the viability of rollback recovery on extreme-scale systems, models for prediction of its performance have been proposed. This model was developed to evaluate the rollback recovery solution for petascale HPC systems <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. An optimal checkpoint and rollback model has been devised that incorporates a reliability function obtained from the analysis of historical failure data from the system event log files <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>. There have also been efforts to develop models that analyze the combination of checkpoint restart with redundancy techniques for MPI applications <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>, and for multilevel checkpointing solutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For future extreme-scale HPC systems, designers will be required to work within tight constraints of cost, power and reliability to achieve greater performance. The use of design patterns enables the exploration of alternative solutions for a specific context and provides a framework to combine individual patterns into complete solutions.
The performance and reliability models for resilience design patterns presented in this paper allow us to develop measures to analyze the solutions built using the patterns.
While these models for the architecture patterns are not detailed enough and refining them will lead to considerable added complexity, they predict the implications of selecting specific combination of patterns for the reliability and performance of a system in a given context.
The models developed in this paper are designed to be useful for simulation frameworks to examine the effectiveness of a resilience solution for specific fault models and fault rates, as well as to measure the performance and reliability characteristics of the pattern-based solution for different system architectures, software environments and application workloads.</p>
