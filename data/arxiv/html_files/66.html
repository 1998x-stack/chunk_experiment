<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">The widespread application of wireless services and dense devices access have triggered huge energy consumption. Because of the environmental and financial considerations, energy-efficient design in wireless networks becomes an inevitable trend. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, energy-efficient orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell optimization comprehensively considering energy efficiency maximization, power allocation, wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation, and user Quality of Service is a novel approach and research direction, and it has not been investigated. In this paper, we study the energy-efficient power allocation and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell networks. Different from the existing resource allocation schemes that maximize the throughput, the studied scheme maximizes energy efficiency by allocating both transmit power of each small cell base station to users and bandwidth for backhauling, according to the channel state information and the circuit power consumption. The problem is first formulated as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem and then it is decomposed into two convex subproblems. A near optimal iterative resource allocation algorithm is designed to solve the resource allocation problem. A suboptimal low-complexity approach is also developed by exploring the inherent structure and property of the energy-efficient design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the existing schemes.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Wireless communication networks have experienced tremendous growth in the past a few decades. It is shown that higher capacity wireless links are expected to meet the increasing quality of service (QoS) demands of multimedia applications, and these high data rate links also result in increasing device power consumption. The next generation communication systems need to provide higher data rate with limited power and bandwidth due to the rapidly increasing demands for multimedia services. Designing energy-efficient wireless communication system becomes an emerging trend, due to rapidly increasing system energy costs and rising requirements of communication capacity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. According to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>, the radio access part is a major energy consumer in conventional wireless cellular networks, and it accounts for up to more than 70 percent of the total energy consumption. Therefore, increasing the energy efficiency of typical wireless networks is important to overcome the challenges raised by the rising demands of energy consumption and communication throughput.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">To offload the overloaded traffics in macrocells and enhance the capacity and energy efficiency of the wireless networks, one proposed method is to shorten the distance between the base stations (BSs) and the user equipments. Small cells (e.g., picocells, femtocells and relay nodes) have been used to improve system capacity in hotspots for relieving the burden on overloaded macrocells, which is considered as a promising technique to provide an effective solution for the challenges in current macrocells <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. Therefore, there is no doubt that small cell has been paid much attention in recent years from academia and industry because it can help the system spatial reuse spectrum with low power consumption and improve the system coverage with low infrastructure cost deployment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>. Heterogeneous small cell networks, where small cells are overlaid within a macrocell to improve coverage and increase system capacity beyond the initial deployment of macrocells, have been regarded as a promising approach to meet the increasing data traffic demand and reduce energy consumption. Although highly promising, many important problems related to heterogeneous small cell networks such as interference mitigation, resource allocation, and QoS provisioning <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> should be addressed to fully reap the potential gains.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Resource allocation, such as power allocation and bandwidth allocation, has been widely used to maximize the energy efficiency under power limitation and QoS in heterogeneous small cell networks. Power allocation for energy efficiency has been widely studied in the literature. The distributed power control game was studied in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> to maximize the energy efficiency of transmission for secondary users in cognitive radio networks and an optimal power control problem was formulated as a repeated game. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, based on the hardcore point process (HCPP), the authors investigated the maximum achievable energy efficiency of the considered multiuser multiantenna HCPP random cellular networks with the aforementioned minimum distance constraint for adjacent BSs. Different from the authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, who took the minimum distance in adjacent BSs into consideration to maximize the energy efficient, we propose a suboptimal low-complexity approach of energy-efficient backhaul bandwidth allocation by optimizing the fraction of bandwidth allocated for wireless backhauling at all small cell BSs within a macrocell range. The authors in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> studied energy-efficient power control and receiver design in cognitive radio networks, and a non-cooperative power control game for maximum energy efficiency of secondary users was considered with a fairness constraint and interference threshold. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> formulated the energy-efficient spectrum sharing and power allocation in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells as a Stackelberg game and they proposed a gradient based iteration algorithm to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium solution to the energy-efficient resource allocation problem. Some works also have been done to consider bandwidth allocation for energy efficiency. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, the authors studied the joint service pricing and bandwidth allocation for energy and cost efficiency at the operator level in a multi-tier network where an operator deploys heterogeneous small cell networks, and they formulated the problem as a Stackelberg game. The problem of joint link selection, power and bandwidth allocation for energy efficiency maximization for Multi-Homing networks was investigated in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. A new energy-efficient scheme was presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to statistically meet the demands for QoS during the bandwidth allocation for wireless networks.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we define that wireless backhaul as the connection between macro BS and small cell BSs, and it is necessary to jointly consider the design of the radio access and backhaul network. Several related works considered the backhaul to improve energy efficiency in wireless networks. The authors of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> studied energy efficiency of resource allocation in multi-cell orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) downlink networks where the limited backhaul capacity, the circuit power consumption and the minimum required data rate are considered. The resource allocation problem for energy-efficient communication with limited backhaul capacity is formulated as an optimization problem. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, an energy efficiency model of small cell backhaul networks with Gauss–Markov mobile models has been proposed. In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>, the authors maximized system energy efficiency in OFDMA small cell networks by optimizing backhaul data rate and emission power, and they proposed a joint forward and backhaul link optimization scheme by taking both the power consumption of forward links and the backhaul links into consideration.</p>

<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">To the best of the authors’ knowledge, energy efficiency of power allocation and wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation in heterogeneous small cell network has not been investigated. In this work, we study the power allocation and bandwidth allocation problem in a heterogeneous small cell network where the small cells use wireless backhauling to maximize energy efficiency of all small cell users. Similar to the paper in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>, we also use Gradient Assisted Binary Search (GABS) Algorithm to solve the energy-efficient power allocation problem.

Fig. 4 indicates that more number of small cell is, the better performance is obtained. It can also be seen from Fig. 4 that the energy efficiency performance of Algorithm 1 is always better than that of Algorithm 2 and the gap between them becomes larger when the number of small cells increases. The energy efficiency performance of Algorithm 1 is 30% superior to that of Algorithm 2 when the number of small cells is 10.</p>

Fig. 5 shows that the total downlink capacity of Algorithm 1 is more than 3 bps/Hz higher than that of Algorithm 2. It can also be seen from Fig. 5 that the more number of users in small cell is, the better performance is obtained due to the multi-user diversity. The total downlink capacity of Algorithm 1 is 21% higher than that of Algorithm 2 when the number of users in each small cell is over 10.</p>

We can also observe that the performance of Algorithm 1 is slightly better than that of the existing algorithm, which is the backhaul bandwidth allocation in conjunction with the resource allocation algorithm in [14].

<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we investigated the energy-efficient wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation and power allocation in a heterogeneous small cell network. We demonstrated the existence of a unique globally optimal energy efficiency solution and provided an iterative algorithm to obtain this optimum. For the downlink scenario, we first found the near optimal energy-efficient resource allocation approach, and then developed a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm by exploring the inherent structure of the objective function and the feature of energy-efficient design. From the simulation results, we observed that energy efficiency is improved by increasing the number of small cells and the number of users per small cell, and the capacity is also improved by increasing the number of small cells and the number of users per small cell. Simulation results showed great energy efficiency improvement of the proposed iterative optimization algorithm than that of the low-complexity optimization algorithm and the existing schemes. The proposed low-complexity algorithms can achieve a promising tradeoff between performance and complexity. If the future, we will investigate the nonunified backhaul bandwidth allocation and inter-small-cell interference in heterogeneous small cell networks.</p>
