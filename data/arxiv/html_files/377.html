<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">I give a fairly systematic and thorough presentation of the case for regarding black holes as thermodynamic systems in the fullest sense, aimed at readers with some familiarity with thermodynamics, quantum mechanics and general relativity but not presuming advanced knowledge of quantum gravity. I pay particular attention to (i) the availability in classical black hole thermodynamics of a well-defined notion of adiabatic intervention; (ii) the power of the membrane paradigm to make black hole thermodynamics precise and to extend it to local-equilibrium contexts; (iii) the central role of Hawking radiation in permitting black holes to be in thermal contact with one another; (iv) the wide range of routes by which Hawking radiation can be derived and its back-reaction on the black hole calculated; (v) the interpretation of Hawking radiation close to the black hole as a gravitationally bound thermal atmosphere. In an appendix I discuss recent criticisms of black hole thermodynamics by Dougherty and Callender. This paper confines its attention to the thermodynamics of black holes; a sequel will consider their statistical mechanics.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Black hole thermodynamics (BHT) is perhaps the most striking and unexpected development in the theoretical physics of the last forty years. It combines the three main areas of ‘fundamental’ theoretical physics — quantum theory, general relativity, and thermal physics — and it offers a conceptual testing ground for quantum gravity that might be the nearest that field has to experimental evidence. Yet BHT itself relies almost entirely on theoretical arguments, and its most celebrated result — Hawking’s argument that black holes emit radiation — has no direct empirical support and little prospect of getting any. So to outsiders — to physicists in other disciplines, or to philosophers of science — the community’s confidence in BHT can seem surprising, or even suspicious. Can we really be so confident of anything without any grounding in observation?</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this article, and its sequel, I want to lay out as carefully and thoroughly as I can the theoretical evidence for BHT. It is written with the zeal of the convert: I began this project sharing at least some of the outsiders’ scepticism, and became persuaded that the evidence is enormously strong both that black holes are thermodynamical systems in the fullest sense of the word, and that their thermodynamic behaviour has a statistical-mechanical underpinning in quantum gravity (and, as a consequence, that black hole evaporation is a unitary process not different in kind from the cooling of other hot systems, and that it involves no fundamental loss of information).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">There are of course many reviews of this material. But those I know either (i) take for granted the main results of BHT, moving quickly over established material to get students up to speed with the research frontier; (ii) are explicitly historical, which illuminates how the community <em id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">in fact</em> came to accept BHT but can obscure the logic of whether and why they <em id="S1.p3.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">should have</em> accepted it, or (iii) are written at a very high level of mathematical rigor, so high that a large fraction of the literature has to be omitted. I hope this paper will be complementary to extant material. With few exceptions, I present and describe results without going into the details of their derivation, and the student who wishes to properly understand the topic will need to read this paper in parallel with some of the extant review literature. My starting points (for this part of the paper) were <span id="S1.p3.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>harlowreview, Jacobson <span id="S1.p3.1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeyear</span>jacobsonblackholelectures,jacobsonqft, <span id="S1.p3.1.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>membraneparadigm, and Wald <span id="S1.p3.1.6" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeyear</span>waldqft,wald2001.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">A note on mathematical rigor: the tendency in foundational work on this subject (see, <span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text">e. g. </span>, <span id="S1.p4.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>belotetalinformationloss and <span id="S1.p4.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>earmanunruh) has been to work at the level of rigor typical in mathematical physics, where all results are stated exactly and proved rigorously. This is much higher than the standard in theoretical physics more generally; it has the advantage of reliability, but the disadvantage that a very large fraction of the literature must be elided — especially in a frontier area like this, where the underlying physical principles are unclear and the mathematical framework partial and under active development. And the case for BHT — as will become apparent throughout this paper and, even more so, its sequel — rests not so much on individual results that have been established with full precision and rigor, but on the many independent calculations with different premises and approximation schemes that all lead to the same result. So this paper is written at the theoretical-physics level; I hope that readers who prefer their mathematics more precise will at least get a sense as to why <em id="S1.p4.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">the community</em> takes BHT so seriously, even if they are not persuaded themselves.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This is a large topic, too large for any one paper. In this paper I confine my attention to phenomenological thermodynamics, setting aside any considerations of statistical-mechanical underpinnings for that thermodynamics. In <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>wallaceblackholestatmech I consider the progress made in calculating the thermodynamical properties of black holes via statistical mechanics (in effective-field theory quantum gravity, in string theory, and via the AdS/CFT correspondence). And in <span id="S1.p5.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>wallaceinformationloss I use these two papers as a starting point to review and assess the notorious <em id="S1.p5.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">information-loss paradox</em> which has motivated a large part of the critical attention paid to BHT.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The structure of the paper is as follows. I begin in section <a href="#S2" title="2 Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics: a brief review ‣ The case for black hole thermodynamics Part I: phenomenological thermodynamics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> by briefly reviewing classical thermodynamics, and discussing how it is modified for self-gravitating systems: to see whether black holes are thermodynamical, we need to be clear what thermodynamics is in the first place. In section <a href="#S3" title="3 Classical black hole thermodynamics ‣ The case for black hole thermodynamics Part I: phenomenological thermodynamics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> I consider classical black hole thermodynamics, arguing that while black holes offer a strikingly good realisation of the principles of thermodynamics when regarded as isolated systems, they completely fail to do so when considered as components of a larger system. In section <a href="#S4" title="4 Quantum field theory ‣ The case for black hole thermodynamics Part I: phenomenological thermodynamics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> I show how including the implications of quantum field theory, in particular (though not exclusively) the Hawking effect, entirely remove this limitation; I also review the strength of the evidence for the Hawking effect itself, and the related but logically stronger claim that Hawking radiation leads to black hole evaporation. In an appendix, I address the arguments of a recent paper by <span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>doughertycallender which criticises BHT (that paper was one trigger for my writing this paper, but engaging with its arguments in the main text would complicate my structure unhelpfully).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Readers familiar with extant debates on black hole thermodynamics may be surprised that in this paper I make virtually no mention of Bekenstein’s classic argument <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bibx5" title="" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeauthoryear</span>BekensteinBekenstein1973</a>]</cite> for black hole entropy on the grounds of information. Partly this is because this paper is confined to phenomenological thermodynamics, and the relation of information to thermodynamics is normally made at the statistical-mechanical level. But mainly it is just because the link between information and thermodynamics is <em id="S1.p7.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">controversial</em>, and so any argument for black hole thermodynamics from considerations of information is apt to inherit that controversy (recent critical takes on black hole thermodynamics by <span id="S1.p7.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>wuthrichblackhole and Dougherty and Callender (<em id="S1.p7.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ibid</em>) both rely in one way or another on skepticism about the entropy-information link).Since (I will argue) we can make a compelling case for BHT and (in the sequel) black hole statistical mechanics without ever considering information, it seems simpler to sidestep the controversy. I discuss this in slightly more detail in the appendix.</p>

It follows that a necessary and sufficient condition for two systems in thermal contact to be jointly at equilibrium is that they are separately at equilibrium with equal temperatures. (This generalises to other forms of contact.) As a consequence, the relation ‘at equilibrium with’ is an equivalence relation: this is the <em id="S2.I2.ix1.p1.3.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Zeroth Law of thermodynamics</em>, and in textbook presentations is often taken as a starting point; in my presentation, it is a consequence of other assumptions.</p>

Indeed, a well-known result in celestial mechanics (the <em id="S2.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">gravothermal catastrophe</em> (<span id="S2.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>lyndenbellwood1968; <span id="S2.SS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>[pp.500-5]binneygalacticdynamics is a good introduction) demonstrates that classical Newtonian systems in which gravity is the only relevant form cannot reach stable equilibrium unless confined to a sufficiently small box. The only gravity-dominated astrophysical systems at thermal equilibrium (other than black holes themselves!) are degenerate-matter objects like white dwarfs and neutron stars, where quantum effects permit stability. Ordinary stars, for instance, are not at thermal equilibrium: there is a constant flow of energy from the core to the surface, and from the surface to interstellar space through emitted radiation; only the presence of fusion reactions in the core to replenish that lost heat allows stars to remain stable, until their fusion fuel is exhausted.</p>

<p id="S2.SS5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">In many examples of self-gravitating bodies, there is another way to put two bodies into thermal contact: seal them both into a very large box with reflecting walls, and wait. If one or other body is above absolute zero, it will emit electromagnetic radiation; in due course, the box will fill with radiation in local thermal equilibrium. Each body is in thermal contact with the radiation and so, indirectly, with the other body. This is an effective way (in principle and in thought, not in engineering practice!) to, for instance, place two neutron stars or white dwarfs into thermal contact. It is not really an option for our radiation spheres, because they are themselves comprised of thermal radiation so the breakdown into subsystems would not be well-defined.</p>

<p id="S3.SS2.p1.4" class="ltx_p">Thermodynamics describes equilibrium systems in terms of their conserved quantities and external constraints. There are no real external constraints applicable to a black hole, but there are quantities which we would expect to be conserved: the energy, momentum and angular momentum of the hole (defined asymptotically by the ADM method) and its electrical charge. In each case these quantities are associated to long-range forces (gravity for the quantities associated to spacetime symmetries; electromagnetism for charge), as these forces ensure that matter bearing the conserved quantity will leave an asymptotic trace on the spacetime even once it crosses the stretched horizon. (Conserved quantities like baryon number, by contrast, cannot be expected to show up in the physics of the black hole exterior, since the long-range physics will be indifferent as to whether a particle that crosses the horizon is, say, a neutron rather than an anti-neutron.)

<p id="S3.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To treat a black hole as a thermodynamic system requires us to identify external interventions, and to divide them into adiabatic changes and heat flows. The former is fairly straightforward: to move a black hole from one equilibrium state to another is going to require us to change its mass, angular momentum or charge, and the simplest way to do that is to drop matter into it. The latter is more delicate, since the division between ‘heat’ and ‘work’ is less obvious in an alien situation like this than for a box of gas. The simplest thing to do (in this case as in other less-familiar cases in ‘regular’ thermodynamics) is to identify which transformations are reversible and which irreversible, and then define the quasi-static adiabatic processes as the reversible ones.</p>

<p id="S3.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The physical reason for caring about this generalisation lies in the effective-field-theory program in contemporary particle physics. From that perspective, general relativity is thought of as a non-renormalisable effective field theory, regularised by a cutoff imposed by unknown Planck-level physics. In such a theory, all possible diffeomorphism-covariant action terms should be present; the Einstein-Hilbert action is just the leading-order term in an infinite expansion of the Lagrangian in these various terms. So the fact that black hole thermodynamics extends so naturally beyond the Einstein-Hilbert case is reassuring for the physical applicability of the theory.</p>

<div id="S3.SS6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">So far as we treat each black hole as an isolated system, the resemblance to a thermodynamic system seems pretty complete: black holes have notions of equilibrium and equilibration, reversibility and irreversibility, and local thermodynamic properties. But the resemblance terminates abruptly — at least as far as classical black holes are concerned — as soon as we try to consider them as thermodynamic systems interacting with other black holes, or with non-black-hole thermodynamic systems.</p>

<div id="S3.SS6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.SS6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Specifically: there seems to be no available process that can reduce the entropy of one black hole and increase that of another (or of a non-black hole thermodynamic system), even if the total entropy is increasing. To the contrary, the analysis of reversible and irreversible processes above applied to each hole separately. Likewise, Hawking’s area theorem applies separately to each connected component of a spacetime’s event horizon, and so mandates not just that the total entropy of a system of black holes is nondecreasing but that the entropy of each black hole is separately nondecreasing. As a corollary, there seems no prospect of running a Carnot cycle between two black holes, and no prospect of allowing heat to flow from one hole to another. Likewise, there seems no way to make sense of heat flow from a black hole, to any other thermodynamic system. The nearest we can get is to allow two black holes to ‘interact’ by colliding, in which case the area theorem guarantees that the new black hole has a larger entropy than its constituents, but this is a pale shadow of genuine thermal contact.</p>

This means that a black hole placed in thermal contact with another body by the method of putting both in a box and letting it fill with radiation will simply eat all the radiation, however low its temperature. The only temperature that we seem consistently able to attribute to a classical black hole is then absolute zero.</p>

As a starting point to understand Hawking radiation, let’s consider for simplicity a free, massless, scalar quantum field theory defined on Schwarzschild spacetime, with metric (<a href="#S3.E15" title="In 3.6 No thermal contact for classical black holes ‣ 3 Classical black hole thermodynamics ‣ The case for black hole thermodynamics Part I: phenomenological thermodynamics" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a>). (Throughout this section, I assume a ’large’ black hole, where curvatures outside the black hole are small compared to the Planck scale and hence quantum-gravitational effects can be neglected; the description of black hole radiation from Planck-scale black holes lies beyond currently-understood physics.)

At the other extreme, (4) is completely general but only applies to a black hole at thermal equilibrium with an external radiation bath, requiring additional physical justifications to be applied to collapse-formed black holes. (1) and (2) give concrete mechanisms for Hawking radiation, whereas (3)-(5) derive contradiction or unphysical paradox from its absence. But collectively, they strongly suggest that Hawking radiation really is a consequence of quantum field theory on curved spacetime, and not simply an artefact of a particular method of mathematical analysis. In turn, quantum field theory on curved spacetime is just an application of the general machinery of modern quantum field theory (in particular, the use of field theory to describe quantum fluctuations against a fixed classical background) and — while it is fair to note that it has not passed the sort of precision tests which underpin support for, say, flat-space quantum electrodynamics, and that the notorious cosmological-constant problem<span id="footnote5" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">5</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">5</span>See <span id="footnote5.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>weinbergcosmologicalconstant, <span id="footnote5.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>PeeblesRatra, and references therein; thanks to Erik Curiel for pointing out its significance here.</span></span></span> gives some grounds for concern about its overall coherence — it is the theoretical underpinning for experimentally-tested results in astrophysics and cosmology, notably interferometry experiments involving photons that have passed through regions of curved spacetime.<span id="footnote6" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">6</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">6</span>Thanks to an anonymous referee for pressing the question of what grounds we have to accept curved-spacetime QFT.</span></span></span></p>

Physicists tend to regard the case for Hawking radiation as further bolstered by the unity it provides to black hole thermodynamics but even without that bolstering, the case is very strong — though, of course, as good scientists we should remind ourselves that it remains purely theoretical, and that tests of quantum field theory itself in the curved-spacetime regime to date have been much less precise and numerous than in the flat-spacetime regime.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Hawking’s original calculation — and all the other calculations referenced above — use quantum field theory on a fixed, non-dynamical background metric. As such, these derivations <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">in of themselves</em> do not suffice to establish that Hawking radiation is fully analogous to ordinary thermal radiation, because they imply nothing about whether a radiating black hole ultimately decreases in mass and, thus, surface area. To establish this, we need to consider the back-reaction of the radiation on the metric field, and doing so in a fully satisfactory way requires a quantum theory of gravity, which of course we lack. Furthermore, given that there is no robust local definition of gravitational energy — and, relatedly, no robust way to understand total energy as a sum of local energies — we cannot <em id="S4.SS3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">simply</em> appeal to a local conservation law to conclude that radiating black holes evaporate.</p>

<div id="S4.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Nonetheless we can give powerful arguments for that conclusion. The most direct is via appeal to Noether’s theorem, applied on a sphere surrounding, and far from, the black hole: in that regime, we expect to be able to treat the hole as an approximately-isolated system in a larger region of Minkowski spacetime (see <span id="S4.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>wallacerpep for more on this). So the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime allow us to write a global conservation law and to argue that the sum of the ADM mass-energy of the black hole plus the total energy of the radiation outside the sphere — which is well defined, since that region is very nearly flat — should be conserved, and hence that the energy flux through the sphere ought to equal the rate of decrease of the black hole mass.</p>

What would be needed to tie up this loose end would be a proof, in semiclassical gravity, of the “generalised second law”: that the entropy of the black hole exterior plus the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is non-decreasing. (As <span id="S4.SS5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>[p.34]harlowreview notes, “generalised second law” is a bit misleading if black hole area really <em id="S4.SS5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">is</em> entropy, in which case this would just be the <em id="S4.SS5.p1.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">ordinary</em> second law. On the other hand, in semiclassical gravity it is the sum of a statistical-mechanical entropy with a purely phenomenological entropy, so it does have a hybrid nature.)</p>

<div id="S4.SS5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The three decades following Bekenstein’s original conjecture saw a substantial if rather disunified literature on various thought experiments intended to support the generalised second law. For instance, Unruh and Wald <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeyear</span>unruhwald1982 argued that the Geroch process is prevented by Hawking radiation: the global entropy maximum of a (small) box of a given energy is achieved when the box is full of thermal radiation at that energy, and that box will float, supported by the radiation pressure of the black hole atmosphere, when it is deep enough into the atmosphere that its temperature matches the local atmosphere temperature. It can readily be shown that if the box is then opened so that its contents fall into the black hole, the entropy increase of the hole equals the entropy in the box. But this argument is controversial (see, <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text">e. g. </span>, <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.3" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeNP</span>bekenstein1999,marolfsorkin) and in any case does not seem to address the case where a black hole is <em id="S4.SS5.p2.1.4" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">formed</em> by mass with a high entropy/energy ratio. Other authors offered various more-or-less rigorous arguments for the Bekenstein bound from quantum field theory, though for a long while Bekenstein’s conjecture proved difficult to make precise, and at one point was thought to rely on some ceiling on the number of distinct fundamental particles (intuitively, the more particles there are, the more states there are at a given energy). See <span id="S4.SS5.p2.1.5" class="ltx_ERROR undefined">\citeN</span>walltenproofs and references therein for a review of various attempts to prove the generalised second law over this period.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Black hole thermodynamics is often described as a striking analog of ordinary thermodynamics. But if what it is to be a thermodynamic system is to obey the various laws of thermodynamics, and to interact with other thermodynamic systems in such a way that the combined system obeys those laws too, then stationary black holes are not <em id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">analogous</em> to thermodynamic systems: they <em id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">are</em> thermodynamic systems, in the fullest sense. More precisely, according to the best physics we currently have, a black hole at (or weakly perturbed from) equilibrium behaves <em id="S5.p1.1.3" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">exactly</em> like a conducting, viscous fluid at (or weakly perturbed from) equilibrium, arranged in a thin shell just outside the event horizon.</p>

<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An obvious question follows. In all other cases we know, there is a statistical-mechanical underpinning both to the general laws of thermodynamics, and to the specific form of the equation of state and transport coefficients of each thermodynamic system. Can we likewise construct a black hole statistical mechanics to underpin black hole thermodynamics — or are black holes fundamentally different from other thermodynamic systems at the microphysical level despite their common phenomenology? I address this topic in Part II.</p>

<p id="A1.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p">To be fair to DC here, in their dialectic they take themselves already to have shown that the formal analogy between black hole thermodynamics and ordinary thermodynamics is weak, so that substantial additional motivation is needed to identify entropy with black hole area. So my criticisms of this section are not really independent of my earlier points.</p>
