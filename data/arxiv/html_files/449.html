<p id="id6.id1" class="ltx_p">Apart from not having crystallized, supercooled liquids can be
considered as being properly equilibrated and thus can be described
by a few thermodynamic control variables. In contrast, glasses and
other amorphous solids can be arbitrarily far away from equilibrium
and require a description of the history of the conditions under
which they formed. In this paper we describe how the locality of
interactions intrinsic to finite-dimensional systems affects the
stability of amorphous solids far off equilibrium. Our analysis
encompasses both structural glasses formed by cooling and colloidal
assemblies formed by compression. A diagram outlining regions of
marginal stability can be adduced which bears some resemblance to
the quasi-equilibrium replica meanfield theory phase diagram of hard
sphere glasses in high dimensions but is distinct from that
construct in that the diagram describes not true phase transitions
but kinetic transitions that depend on the preparation protocol.
The diagram exhibits two distinct sectors. One sector corresponds to
amorphous states with relatively open structures, the other to high
density, more closely-packed ones. The former transform rapidly
owing to there being motions with no free energy barriers; these
motions are string-like locally. In the dense region, amorphous
systems age via compact activated reconfigurations. The two regimes
correspond, in equilibrium, to the collisional or uniform liquid and
the so called landscape regime, respectively. These are separated by
a spinodal line of dynamical crossovers. Owing to the rigidity of
the surrounding matrix in the landscape, high-density part of the
diagram, a sufficiently rapid pressure quench adds compressive
energy which also leads to an instability toward string-like motions
with near vanishing barriers. Conversely, a dilute collection of
rigid particles, such as a colloidal suspension leads, when
compressed, to a spatially heterogeneous structure with percolated
mechanically-stable regions. This jamming corresponds to the onset
of activation when the spinodal line is traversed from the low
density side. We argue that a stable glass made of sufficiently
rigid particles can also be viewed as exhibiting sporadic and
localized buckling instabilities that result in local jammed
structures. The lines of instability we discuss resemble the Gardner
transition of meanfield systems but, in contrast, do not result in
true criticality owing to being short-circuited by activated
events. The locally marginally stable modes of motion in amorphous
solids correspond to secondary relaxation processes in structural
glasses. Their relevance to the low temperature anomalies in glasses
is also discussed.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Rigidity can emerge, seemingly miraculously, from the interaction of
many pieces that are loosely connected: Tents, arches, and domes are
among the earliest inventions of humans. Likewise, small fluctuations
can sometimes cause such structures to collapse without
warning. Although statics has been part of the architectural
curriculum since ancient times, only in the 19th century did Maxwell
write down general criteria for building a stable structure out of
many unmoving but loosely connected parts. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Maxwell (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1864</a>)</cite>
His ideas have resurfaced in the last decades in the description of
amorphous solids such as granular assemblies, at the macroscopic
level, and glasses at the molecular size scale. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Phillips and Thorpe (<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">1985</a>)</cite>
This modern complex of ideas emphasizes the importance of a “jammed
state” of matter, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> which describes an
assembly that just barely holds together (i.e. is “marginally
stable”) but does so under the constraint of a large external
pressure.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">An apparently distinct view of the emergence of rigidity in amorphous
solids more suited to the molecular scale has also emerged, based on
the notions of aperiodic crystals and the complexity of the free
energy landscapes of disordered systems that have a thermodynamically
large number of aperiodic minima. This view comes to terms with the
fact that the molecular constituents of amorphous solids are in a
state of cease-less atomic motion. The availability of many possible
states of repose for static heaps of the constituent particles then
not only raises the possibility of flow between these states but also
makes such flow inevitable at any finite temperature. Thus Maxwell’s
criteria for engineering macroscopic structures need to be
supplemented, in such molecular systems, by considerations of dynamics
and thermodynamics. We see that the rigidity of glasses must be only
apparent: Flow simply becomes so slow that an amorphous solid acts as
a rigid body on human timescales and the puzzle of rigidity becomes
the puzzle of explaining the origin of those extraordinary
timescales. The most comprehensive quantitative explanation of these
long timescales of motion in amorphous solids is provided by the
Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory of glasses. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007a</a>); Lubchenko (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> This theory explains that the slowness arises from the
difficulty of finding ways of rearranging loose regions from one
jumbled state of repose (“an aperiodic crystal”) to another such
mechanically stable configuration. Intermittently transiting from one
aperiodic crystal arrangement to another, the system can be called a
“glassy liquid.” This difficulty of finding alternative aperiodic
structures grows as the thermal motion diminishes and thereby
diminishes the availability of new configurations to which one can
move, an impending entropy crisis. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kauzmann (<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">1948</a>)</cite> If one could reach
this entropy crisis, a true phase transition into a unique but
aperiodic crystal is envisioned to occur.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The RFOT theory relies on the locality of interactions in order to
understand the finite time dynamics but a great deal of progress has
been made formalizing RFOT ideas in a meanfield limit appropriate for
an infinite dimensional system. Because of the dimensionality,
activated flow events become forbidden below a critical temperature
and strict “replica symmetry breaking” occurs so that the system can
remain forever trapped in one of an exponentially large number of
states.

of predictions that mirror many of the ideas about jamming that had
emerged from the Maxwell-inspired constraint theory of amorphous
assemblies. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Liu <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> In the meanfield models, these
Maxwell constraints become just marginally satisfied at the so-called
Gardner transition,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Charbonneau <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> which corresponds to
an isostatic arrangement of particles. While everything is
theoretically crisp in the mean field limit, how these ideas are to be
carried over to systems in finite dimensions with local interactions,
where finite time scales enter, is a question of kinetics not
thermodynamics. This topic is addressed in the present paper.</p>

<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Within the RFOT theory, the emergence of stable states of repose out

fractal and resemble strings or percolation
clusters. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Unger and Klein (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">1984</a>)</cite> Using this idea, Stevenson,
Schmalian, and Wolynes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Stevenson <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite> described how to locate the point on
the equilibrium phase diagram where activated dynamics would start to
take over from the collisional transport, the so called landscape
regime. At temperatures above this transition point, mode coupling
theory describes the slowing of the dynamics but the MCT singularities
are smoothed by the lower barrier activated events which become the
dominant relaxation mechanism at still lower temperatures. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kirkpatrick and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>); Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003a</a>); Bhattacharyya <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite> These fractal excitations also exist in
a non-equilibrium glass and there, they give rise to secondary or beta
relaxations. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Johari and Goldstein (<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">1970</a>)</cite> Interestingly Kirkpatrick and
Wolynes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kirkpatrick and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite> speculated that the Gardner transition in the
meanfield Potts glasses discussed by Gross et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gross <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">1985</a>)</cite> was connected to these secondary
relaxations in the structural glasses already in 1987. The approach we
pursue here is to see how these fractal excitations not only remain in
the glassy state but can themselves proliferate leading to mechanical
instability if an amorphous solid is put under high pressure. This
instability occurs because the rigidity of the amorphous matrix allows
it to maintain stresses like an arch or dome about a region that
reconfigures thereby adding to the driving force for such
reconfiguration events. The resulting analysis leads to a diagram that
highlights how low barrier processes can arise at high pressure in a
finite dimensional system near a jamming point. This diagram bears
some resemblance to the well-studied phase diagram of the infinite
dimensional hard sphere system but is distinct in several essential
aspects. Most importantly, the strict phase transition lines of the

meanfield theory the minima are separated by infinite barriers, the
system must remain, upon further quenching, in a single one of these
minima of the free energy. If the system is then cooled further, the
pressure and density would follow a curve that coincides with the
lowest density iso-complexity line in Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Aging, jamming, and the limits of stability of amorphous solids" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>. By definition,
the complexity is the logarithm of the multiplicity of the free energy
minima, per particle. Yet when Boltzmann-averaged over the totality of
the minima, the resulting equation of state is simply a smooth
continuation, toward higher densities, of the equilibrium equation of
state of the uniform liquid. As a formal construct, one may imagine an
ideal non-local move set that would allow one to continue to compress
the liquid along the so obtained “equilibrium” equation of state and
then perform a quench starting at any temperature below <math id="S1.p6.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="T_{A}" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p6.4.m4.1a"><msub id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">T</mi><mi id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">A</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p6.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.2">𝑇</ci><ci id="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S1.p6.4.m4.1.1.3">𝐴</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p6.4.m4.1c">T_{A}</annotation></semantics></math>.

true phase transition in this diagram. Many states with different
pressures and densities throughout the plane can be achieved depending
on the sample history. We consider all the states in the colored part
of the diagram as being potentially accessible. Even under uniform
cooling or compression, many different quenching protocols can be
realized depending on the speed of quenching. Obviously, many
different sequences of cooling and compression or heating and pressure
release can be envisioned. Quenches that start below the crossover to
activated transport result in a frozen glass (the blue region on the
diagram) whose structure initially is not significantly
configurationally perturbed relative to the original equilibrated
liquid. Each particle largely maintains the same set of neighbors
which had formed a transient cage around it already in the equilibrium
state. The system falls out of equilibrium when the relaxation and
quenching time scales match. Still, aging towards lower free energy
states will occur via local, compact activated processes, generally
accompanied by a significant increase in the density along with a
decrease in the pressure; these aging events can be quantified as we
have described in our previous work on aging. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>
Following an activated aging event, the existing cages in the
aperiodic crystal are locally replaced by slightly different cages. In
the reconfiguring region, individual particles move distances
comparable to the typical vibrational displacement within a cage. Each
particle nevertheless remains surrounded by the same set of nearest
neighbors as before the event. Several reconfiguration events would be
needed for the identity of the neighbors to be fully reset. Save for
effects of volume relaxation, which we will now focus on, the above
microscopic picture is very much like that developed earlier by us
where we focused primarily of shallow thermal
quenches. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> We see that amorphous solids can regarded as

<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Suppose we continue a thermal quench. Once the quench becomes
sufficiently deep, the vibrational amplitude of a given particle may
become less than the gap to some of its neighbors so the particle
finds itself colliding with a smaller set of neighbors than it was
making contact with in the beginning of the quench. This breaking of
local symmetry comes from the individual cages not being strictly
isotropic when the system comes out of equilibrium. If the number of
long-lived collisional contacts becomes less than the number of
Maxwell constraints, the system becomes locally unstable. The
microscopic consequences of the resulting instability strongly depend
both on the density and pressure. We emphasize that for systems away
from equilibrium, there is no one-to-one correspondence between
pressure and density (at a fixed temperature) Both parameters must be
specified separately in order to describe both instability and jamming
at high pressures.</p>

<div id="S1.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">We will see that for a sufficiently deep quench, the local relaxations
result in such a significant increase in coordination—and a
concomitant local pressure decrease—that the energy released in
reconfiguring can drive the barrier for reconfiguration to zero.
Particle in the reconfigured region will move a distance significantly
exceeding the typical vibrational amplitude thus destroying the
existing cages and then forming new cages using a distinct set of
neighbors, in an avalanche-like fashion. When one particle escapes
its existing cage, the avalanche motion will resemble a string whose
direction changes. The avalanche also can branch leading to a fractal
percolation-like cluster of rearranged particles. This instability
toward fractal motions is well documented in equilibrated glassy
liquids: <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Gebremichael <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> The mathematics resembles a

collisional <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003a</a>)</cite> and can be described by extended
mode-coupling theory. This transition is a crossover <span id="S1.p10.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">spinodal</span>. We will also observe that for sufficiently rigid
particles, the string instability seems to be related to a set of
significantly milder instabilities in which particles confined to
anisotropic cages will have to choose one end of the cage over the
other. This other end of the cage will partially collapse—or
“buckle”—upon further quenching, resulting in a local jamming
event.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p11.1" class="ltx_p">We note that achieving sufficiently high dimensionless pressures in
molecular systems, in order to encounter the transitions to marginal
stability, is hard. For these reasons, we believe quench-induced
marginal stability is unlikely to underlie the low temperature
anomalies observed in the laboratory for structural glasses. On the
other hand, in granular and colloidal particles, these high
dimensionless pressures can be achieved but these systems are made of
larger constituents and are difficult to equilibrate at high densities
owing to their intrinsically long time scales for particle
motion. Colloidal assemblies are typically prepared at pressures and
densities where strings nucleate largely unimpeded. Once frozen, such
systems will age largely by string-like motions, not compact
reconfigurations. We shall see that when such systems are densified
past the spinodal, the local increases in density lead rapidly to
activation barriers so the aging will be significantly slowed down. As
a result, colloidal assemblies will become spatially heterogeneous
collections of nearly mechanically-unstable configurations. Being
trapped in such configurations on experimentally relevant timescales
will lead to a nearly marginally stable, jammed structure at infinite
pressure. A quench starting from the low density phase and crossing
the string spinodal will rapidly lead to the onset of apparent
mechanical rigidity.</p>

<div id="S1.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p12.1" class="ltx_p">True criticality is not expected at the string spinodal or the
buckling instability in this high pressure region because at finite
temperature, long-range correlations will be destroyed by the

singularity is short-cut by the activated reconfigurations to
equilibrium. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Kirkpatrick and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">1987</a>)</cite> The lack of such criticality excludes the
possibility of a true macroscopic instability—hence the article’s

long times compared to vibrational times but eventually transforms in
an activated fashion so that the liquid can flow. The corresponding
degrees of freedom labelling the distinct mechanically stable
configurations are usually referred to as “configurational” degrees
of freedom. Their thermodynamics is largely decoupled from the
vibrations, see Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Lubchenko, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a></cite> for a pedagogical exposition.
The key thermodynamic quantity is the configurational part of the
entropy, which reflects the multiplicity of the aperiodic free energy
minima.</p>

as curves with arrows. By the collapse of the interior of a
reconfigured region, any initial state belonging to such a curve would
relax, within that region, to the equilibrium state located at the
high density end of the curve. To avoid confusion we remind the
reader that the intermediate portions of these “local-collapse
curves” do not correspond to kinetic intermediates; a single aging
event leads the system directly to the state on the equilibrium
equation-of-state line in the interior of the aged region. To solve

aging-induced escape occurs from a particular aperiodic minimum, the
configurational entropy of the initial state is zero by
construction. Thus in the usual way, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>); Lubchenko and Rabochiy (<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> the

<p id="S2.p9.13" class="ltx_p">For soft particles, the dependence of the vibrational amplitude—and
thus vibrational entropy—on pressure is more complicated and,
furthermore, system-dependent. In any event, this dependence is
significantly weaker than the already mild, logarithmic dependence in

the reconfigured region, which would generally depend on anharmonicity
and quantum effects. For rigid objects, this difference is strictly
zero. For classical oscillators, it also vanishes in the harmonic
limit. Accounting for effects of anharmonicity would not significantly
improve the accuracy of approximation, see the discussion of
Eq. (<a href="#S2.E10" title="In II Reconfiguration barriers and the marginal stability in far-from-equilibrium glasses ‣ Aging, jamming, and the limits of stability of amorphous solids" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">10</span></a>); these effects, if any, will be therefore
ignored.
Finally, we inquire whether there is an enthalpic stabilization of the
<span id="S2.p9.13.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">environment</span> of the reconfigured region. For linear elasticity,
the environment experiences only shear but no uniform dilation, as
already mentioned. Thus the radial stress is exactly compensated by
the lateral stress and so, no stabilization is expected at this level
of approximation.

<p id="S2.p14.1" class="ltx_p">and thus the relaxed inerior pressure becomes arbitrarily smaller than
than the external pressure as the latter grows to be infinite. The
resulting, arbitrarily large pressure discontinuity arising from the
matrix’ rigidity implies that the outside region is unable to relax to
fill the effective void formed within the reconfigured region and,
thus, is <span id="S2.p14.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">jammed</span> in a dome-like configuration. While domes made
of engineered blocks can be perfectly stable, no such stability can be
expected from a dome made of frictionless spheres with finite thermal
vibration. At the same time, we have seen that while the
reconfiguration barrier saturates at a finite value, with increasing
pressure, the inter-particle forces can be made arbitrarily large, in
which case <span id="S2.p14.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">finite</span>-sized displacements of particle become
virtually barrierless: If formed in this regime, the “dome” would
promptly collapse from any thermal motion! Another way to look at this
is that the vibrational displacement in the original quenched
structure can be made arbitrarily small by sufficient external
compression.

This means there will be individual one-particle reconfigurations that
have small barriers. Thus a series of reconfiguration events would
then occur in a spatially contiguous fashion so as to form <span id="S2.p15.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">strings</span> and, ultimately, percolation clusters, see

that owing to fluctuation and the emergence of activated dynamics, the

softening effects, which would then show both the computed barrier and
cooperativity size vanishing in a critical fashion at the
spinodal. The softening effects stem from spatial variations of the
local order parameters and effectively erase the activated barrier at
the spinodal, so the liquid motions are slowed exclusively owing to
mode-coupling effects or other effects such as the viscous drag of
colloidal particles against the solvent. Away from the spinodal, the
barrier-softening effects become increasingly less important, see

Wolynes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Wisitsorasak and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> have shown that externally imposed
shear on glasses leads to an instability. This argument gives
quantitative values for the yield strength of glasses. Thus we see
that if a local aging event occurs in a system that is on the high
density side of the crossover line but not too far away from it, the
surrounding regions will in turn become unstable to forming additional
fractal excitations thus facilitating a series of avalanches
nearby. After reconfiguration, the newly equilibrated regions, now
denser than they were before, will lead to force percolation.
Detailed analysis of these facilitation effects will be a subject of
future work.</p>

particle-particle gap along the short axes of the cage can be made
arbitrarily smaller than the gaps to particles along the longer
axis. This implies that the particle in question would be considered
as making contact with only a fraction of its original neighbors, if
jammed to high pressure. If the resulting number of contacts is less
than that required for mechanical stability, the particle’s being in
the middle of the cage corresponds to an unstable, hypostatic
configuration, not a mechanically stable local free energy. It follows
that the latter unstable configuration will itself be a transition
state separating two <span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">stable</span> configurations, one of which will be
inevitably chosen thus implying a symmetry breaking transition. This
transition will be accompanied by the formation of a region with
modestly less coordination on the other end of cage. This cage
“buckling” can be thought of as the initiation of a stringy or
fractal reconfiguration event.</p>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have analyzed the activated events and instabilities in the
amorphous solids in an approximation that accounts for the exponential
multiplicity of glassy aperiodic crystals but that neglects the
fluctuations in specific volume, energy, and configurational entropy
that inevitably arise from this diversity. Xia and
Wolynes <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Xia and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib67" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> showed how the fluctuations in driving force for
activated transitions can account for dynamical heterogeneity. Their
analysis predicted, in quantitative agreement with experiment, the
correlation between the stretching exponent for the alpha relaxation
in equilibrated glassy liquids and liquid fragility. Stevenson and
Wolynes later showed how these driving force fluctuations also act to
smear out the instabilities due to fractal excitations. This smearing
then gives rise to a tail to the barrier distribution referred to as
the secondary or beta relaxations. Their theory also predicts that
beta relaxation events have merged with the alpha relaxation near the
crossover point.</p>

<p id="S4.p2.7" class="ltx_p">In the moderate pressure regime for amorphous solids these earlier
analyses should suffice but since at high external pressure the
driving force also has a contribution from the volume mismatch energy,
the fluctuations of the latter need to be accounted for at high
pressures. These fluctuations should depend on fluctuations in
specific volume and shear modulus. We leave further analysis of the
fluctuation effects, owing to its complexity, to future work. We note
that fluctuations in the driving force can, if large enough,
completely destroy the random first order transition itself and turn
it into a continuous one. This was discussed by Stevenson et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Stevenson <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> in their explicit mapping of glassy liquid
landscapes onto magnets with both random fields and random
couplings. Near equilibrium for molecular liquids, their analysis
predicted that the one step RSB transition remains intact. The
fluctuations in driving force, in principle, however could become
large enough to destroy the 1-RSB transition at large pressures. To

This implies that fluctuations in the driving
force should modify the energetics of activation only quantitatively,
not qualitatively. In any event, the present argument leaves open the
possibility of an additional region of marginal stability at high
pressures near the densest random-close packing, see also our earlier
remarks regarding the buckling-instability line.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">To zeroth order, amorphous solids can be thought of as being quenched
liquids. But when we look more deeply, we see that their properties do
depend on the way they are prepared. In this regard it is important to
realize that in terms of our diagram plotted in terms of dimensionless
quantities, the quenching protocols are typically quite different for
making molecular glasses than they are for preparing amorphous solids
made of larger particles such as colloids or grains. Ultimately these
differences trace back to the enormous size differences between atoms,
colloidal particles, and grains. Molecular glasses, owing to their
being made of rapidly moving atomic-scale constituents, become
sensibly rigid and fall out of equilibrium in the laboratory only deep
in the activated regime, when the activation barriers are quite high,
leading to times fourteen orders of magnitude beyond the basic
molecular scale. In contrast, the intrinsic thermal motions of
colloids or granular objects are already quite slow even when
unactivated because the particles are so large. This means the
emergence of even a very modest barrier is enough to lead to apparent
rigidity on human time scales. Another contrast between molecular
glasses and colloidal assemblies is that the hard-sphere, or kinetic,
part of the pressure is already very large for molecular liquids
before they are quenched but in the total pressure, this hard sphere
contribution is nearly canceled by a very large attractive
contribution due to inter-particle cohesive
forces. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Longuet-Higgins and Widom (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">1964</a>)</cite> Thus very high dimensionless
kinetic pressures are very difficult to achieve for molecular liquids
by compression in the laboratory. They typically require at least
megapascals to have any significant effects; such pressures require
specialized apparatus. For colloids or granular assemblies, in
contrast, there is little problem achieving, in the laboratory, very
high dimensionless kinetic pressures because the absolute number
density of the constituents of such assemblies is orders of magnitude
lower in absolute terms, so the compression energy is easy to
maintain. These differences between molecular and colloidal systems
mean that the compression effects highlighted in this paper hardly
show up in laboratory studies or molecular glasses but become
paramount for experiments on granular assemblies or colloids. The high
compression possible for the colloids or granular assemblies means
that ”jamming” occurs quite readily for them but does not occur to any
extent for molecular glasses. At the same time compression still can
only barely take a typical colloidal system into the activated
region. This implies amorphous solids prepared from grains or colloids
inevitably end up being near the line of marginal stability but
molecular glasses prepared in the laboratory will generally not be
marginally stable but will be deep in the activated regime.</p>

<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Colloidal suspensions differ in an essential way from molecular
liquids in that their dimensionless kinetic pressure is much lower
than the dimensionless pressures that is ordinarily applied by the
experimenter. (This fact is often referred to as such a suspension
being nearly zero temperature, a notion that is even more pertinent to
granular matter.) Accordingly, the collisional timescale, which is
now set by the viscosity of the solvent and the very large particle
size, is so long that configurational equilibration is intrinsically
much slower than in molecular-scale glassformers, easily by 10 orders
of magnitude. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> Thus we conclude that colloidal suspensions
will typically approach the string crossover from the <span id="S5.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">low</span>
density side, where they become solidified. Upon compression, the
suspension begins to relax toward high density states at an (osmotic)
pressure greatly exceeding its equilibrium value (but still much lower
than experimenter-inflicted forces!). Until the string-crossover line
is reached, relaxations are essentially barrierless, being limited
primarily by the viscous drag of the solvent on the individual
colloidal particles. During such relaxation, individual particles will
move distances comparable to the particle spacing. However, once the
crossover is reached, there will now arise activation
barriers, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Lubchenko and Wolynes (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003a</a>)</cite> which will further slow down the relaxation,
while the particle displacements will become significantly smaller and
comparable to the typical vibrational amplitude. The latter amplitude
decreases inversely proportionally with the pressure, as already
mentioned. Because of the emergence of activation, the suspension will
be largely arrested on experimentally relevant scales beyond but very
near to the spinodal line.</p>

<p id="S5.p6.1" class="ltx_p">The above discussion of colloidal suspensions is also directly
relevant to computer simulations of hard spheres that are monodisperse
or nearly so. In this case, the “experimenter’s” time scale must
again be very short out of necessity because monodisperse hard spheres
actually crystallize readily. On the other hand, heterodisperse
mixtures do not crystallize so easily, which allows simulations to go
somewhat deeper in the activated regime. One caveat is that it is not
clear at present to what extent the slow processes in such
polydisperse mixtures could entail phase separation and de-mixing. The
latter effects seem to be particularly important in continuously
heterodisperse mixtures, whose mixing entropy is strictly infinite,
see however Ref. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">Ozawa and Berthier, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a></cite>. We leave this

<p id="S5.p7.2" class="ltx_p">We have mentioned a way of looking at the symmetry breaking taking
place in quenched glasses as a “buckling transition.” Conceivably
from this viewpoint, the low-density, replica-symmetric and
high-density, 1-stage RSB region will be separated by a distinct set
of instabilities that formally correspond with higher-than-one state
RSB. Despite the poetic similarity of the buckling instability with
the meanfield Gardner transition, the connection between the two, if
any, is not yet clear. In any event, it is quite reasonable that at
the spinodal between the replica-symmetric and 1-step RSB sectors,
there is a potential for a continuous replica-symmetry breaking. The
latter notion is consistent with the findings by Dzero et
al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Dzero <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib74" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>, <a href="#bib.bib75" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite> that interfaces between

about four orders of magnitude. This corresponds to gigapascals. Such
pressures have been achieved in studies of organic
glassformers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Casalini and Roland (<a href="#bib.bib76" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> and we hope that further
experiments along these lines will be performed. According to our
analysis, however, to see the compression-induced instability requires
this pressurization to be sufficiently fast to avoid aging toward more
stable structures. Once such aging occurs, still higher pressures are
required to observe the spinodal coming from the high density, glassy
side. In any event, the spinodal obviously cannot be reached using
conventional thermal quenches because in the latter, the ambient
pressure remains comparable to atmospheric pressure. This difficulty
of observing marginal stability comes exclusively from the attractive
interactions in actual molecular systems positioning them already
quite high in the dimensionless kinetic pressure.</p>

<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Although our arguments were explicitly illustrated in this paper using
hard monodisperse spheres, arguments like those presented here are
also applicable to <span id="S5.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">soft</span> particles, such as actual molecules or
the soft repulsive spheres mentioned earlier in the context of studies
of unjamming transitions by Ikeda et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Ikeda <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib70" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> Equations
of state for molecular substances can be mapped onto those for hard
spheres; see the Supplementary Information for a qualitative
discussion of correlation between the slope of configurationally
adiabatic quenches and the fragility of the liquid. We have already
mentioned that the slope of the string spinodal near the equilibrium
crossover is expected to be greater for molecular liquids than for
strictly hard objects. This implies that reaching the spinodal
instability from the landscape side in such liquids is even harder for
systems with soft repulsion than for hard spheres, in light of the
aforementioned difficulties of rapidly creating and then sustaining,
in the laboratory, high pressures in molecular systems. When dealing
with molecules, quantum effects could play a role; these effects
depend on the absolute particle masses, of course. Such quantum
effects are not expected to affect significantly the location of the
string spinodal. Indeed, no quantities entering the condition

vibrational free energy difference, which would have both an entropic
part and a zero energy contribution. The vibrational free energy
change during isothermal aging—which was dropped from

that marginal stability due to buckling will be <span id="S5.p9.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">also</span> efficiently
suppressed by the quantum effects, see the Supplementary
Information. Finally, at the high pressures requisite for marginal
stability various structural transitions of electronic origin
generally begin to occur. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Grochala <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib77" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite> These are beyond

nanoclusters of appropriate size or, perhaps, artificial polymers or
biomolecules so that the intrinsic time scale of motion is neither too
short nor too long. Unfortunately, nanoclusters in this size range
have rather complicated particle-particle interactions. The
unavoidably large dispersion forces must be compensated by Coulomb
repulsion in order to avoid aggregation, which itself leads already to
rather complicated phase behaviors, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pan <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">et al.</em> (<a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite> such as the
