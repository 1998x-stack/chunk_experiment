<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In the core accretion model, gas-giant planets first form a solid core, which then accretes gas from a protoplanetary disk when the core exceeds a critical mass. Here, we model the atmosphere of a core that grows by accreting ice-rich pebbles. The ice fraction of pebbles evaporates in warm regions of the atmosphere, saturating it with water vapor. Excess water precipitates to lower altitudes. Beneath an outer radiative region, the atmosphere is convective, following a moist adiabat in saturated regions due to water condensation and precipitation. Atmospheric mass, density and temperature increase with core mass. For nominal model parameters, planets with core masses (ice + rock) between 0.08 and 0.16 Earth masses have surface temperatures between 273 K and 647 K and form an ocean. In more massive planets, water exists as a super-critical convecting fluid mixed with gas from the disk. Typically, the core mass reaches a maximum (the critical mass) as a function of the total mass when the core is 2-5 Earth masses. The critical mass depends in a complicated way on pebble size, mass flux, and dust opacity due to the occasional appearance of multiple core-mass maxima. The core mass for an atmosphere of 50 percent hydrogen and helium may be a more robust indicator of the onset of gas accretion. This mass is typically 1-3 Earth masses for pebbles that are 50 percent ice by mass, increasing with opacity and pebble flux, and decreasing with pebble ice/rock ratio.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The formation of gas-giant planets like Jupiter is a central problem in planetary science. These objects contain large amounts of hydrogen and helium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Owen et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>)</cite>, which were presumably acquired from the gaseous portion of their star’s protoplanetary disk. Most disks are found around stars less than a few million years old <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Haisch et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite>, and this sets an upper limit on the time available to form gas giants. This time constraint is more severe than for rocky planets, such as Earth, which may acquire much of their bulk after the protoplanetary disk disperses.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Reproducing the existence and characteristics of gas giants is a challenging test for theories of planet formation. Moreover, understanding giant-planet formation is essential for understanding the origin and character of planetary systems in general, since gravitational perturbations from giant planets can effect the growth of objects elsewhere in the same system <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Chambers &amp; Cassen, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2002</a>; Levison &amp; Agnor, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>. For example, perturbations from Jupiter and Saturn play a central role in many models for the origin of the Sun’s asteroid belt <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wetherill, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">1992</a>; Chambers &amp; Wetherill, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>; Walsh et al., <a href="#bib.bib38" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. The gravitational influence of giant planets is further enhanced by the apparent tendency of many giants to migrate radially during or after their formation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Trilling et al., <a href="#bib.bib36" title="" class="ltx_ref">1999</a>; Armitage, <a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Usually, the formation of gas-giant planets is described using the “core-accretion” model. Here, a giant begins as a solid protoplanet that grows by accreting asteroid-sized planetesimals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>; Movshovitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. Gas in the vicinity of the protoplanet is compressed and heated by the protoplanet’s gravity, forming an extended atmosphere surrounding a solid core. The mass of the atmosphere is determined by a balance between the inward pull of gravity and the outward pressure gradient. Typically, the atmospheric mass increases rapidly with increasing core mass <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>. For a given set of conditions there is a critical core mass above which a static atmosphere is no longer possible <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mizuno, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>)</cite>. If the core exceeds the critical mass, gas flows into the atmosphere from the disk at an increasing rate, eventually forming a massive, gas-rich planet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Multiple factors can affect the critical core mass, in particular the luminosity, opacity, and composition of the atmosphere <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Stevenson, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">1982</a>; Hori &amp; Ikoma, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. Lowering the opacity and/or luminosity increases the density in the atmosphere, raising the mass of the atmosphere for a given core mass. This in turn reduces the critical core mass. The main source of luminosity is energy released by infalling planetesimals, while opacity in the outer atmosphere is mostly due to dust embedded in the gas <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Mizuno, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>)</cite>. Early studies of giant-planet formation typically assumed opacities appropriate for an interstellar dust size distribution, leading to large critical core masses, around 10–20 Earth masses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>. More recent works that account for dust coagulation within the atmosphere find lower opacities and critical core masses below 10 Earth masses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Movshovitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Mordasini, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Previous studies have mainly considered atmospheres with compositions similar to the Sun—that is roughly 99% hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of heavier elements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>; Rafikov, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>; Movshovitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Piso &amp; Youdin, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>. However, the atmospheric composition can be altered by the addition of material evaporating from planetesimals as they fall towards the core <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Stevenson, <a href="#bib.bib34" title="" class="ltx_ref">1984</a>; Hori &amp; Ikoma, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. The evaporated materials have higher molecular weights than hydrogen and helium, which can substantially increase the density of the atmosphere. For atmospheres dominated by heavy elements, the critical core mass can be smaller than Earth or even Mars <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hori &amp; Ikoma, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>; Venturini et al., <a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">While conventional models consider cores that accrete planetesimals, some recent studies have suggested that planets acquire their solid material in the form of mm-to-m-sized pebbles instead <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lambrechts &amp; Johansen, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>; Levison et al., <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>; Chambers, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite>. There is some observational evidence that pebbles are abundant in protoplanetary disks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Testi et al., <a href="#bib.bib35" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>; Wilner et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite>. Pebble accretion may also alleviate the problem of forming critical-mass cores within the lifetime of a protoplanetary disk. Pebbles experience strong drag with disk gas during an encounter with a core, greatly increasing the capture probability and the core growth rate in some circumstances <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Ormel &amp; Klahr, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>; Lambrechts &amp; Johansen, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Outside a protoplanetary disk’s ice line, pebbles are likely to be a mixture of volatile ices and refractory materials (silicates, metals etc., referred to here as “rock”). Temperatures in a protoplanet’s atmosphere increase with depth <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rafikov, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>, so the icy component of incoming pebbles will evaporate in most cases, raising the molecular weight of the atmosphere and lowering the critical core mass. This process is likely to be much more effective than evaporation from planetesimals for two reasons: (i) the surface area to volume ratio of pebbles is much greater due to the small size of pebbles, and (ii) pebbles typically settle towards the core relatively slowly, at terminal velocity, whereas planetesimals approach at roughly the escape velocity of the core. This allows more time for evaporation to occur.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Relatively little evaporation will take place in the cool, outer regions of an atmosphere since the vapor pressure of water is low here, and the atmosphere soon becomes saturated. Above a certain temperature, however, the ice component of pebbles will evaporate entirely. Pebbles with a solar composition of condensible materials will have an ice-to-rock ratio of roughly unity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lodders, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>. Thus, cores that grow by accreting icy pebbles should have vapor-rich atmospheres that are more massive than the core itself, when the hydrogen/helium component is taken into account. This contrasts with the standard H/He dominated case where the critical mass usually occurs when the core and atmospheric masses are comparable <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">So far, the atmospheres of planets undergoing pebble accretion have received relatively little attention. In this paper, we investigate the growth and structure of the atmospheres of giant-planet cores below the critical mass as they accrete ice-rich pebbles. We examine the various stages that such planets pass through as they grow, and determine the point at which they reach the critical mass. This work extends previous studies in several ways: (i) using realistic estimates for the pebble accretion rate rather than adopting a fixed luminosity, (ii) allowing for varying atmospheric composition with depth due to water condensation and precipitation, and (iii) including the presence of an ocean where appropriate.</p>

<p id="S1.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model used for the protoplanet’s atmosphere and the rate of pebble accretion.

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We consider a single protoplanet moving on a circular orbit in a gas-rich protoplanetary disk. A constant mass flux of pebbles drifts past the planet, moving towards the star due to gas drag. For simplicity, the pebbles are assumed to be composed of rock and water ice only. A fraction of the pebbles are captured by the planet. The rocky component of these pebbles is assumed to sediment to the planet’s solid core. At each radial distance from the core, the pebbles’ ice component is assumed to evaporate immediately until the local atmosphere is saturated in water vapor, or until the ice has evaporated completely. If the pebbles still contain some ice when they reach the base of the atmosphere this ice is added to the solid core, or forms an ocean entirely composed of liquid water directly above the core, depending on the temperature at this point.</p>

The atmosphere is heated by the gravitational energy released by infalling pebbles, and this is assumed to be the only significant source of heating. In the inner regions of the atmosphere, this energy is typically transported outwards by convection, while heat transport in the outer atmosphere is by radiation. The outer regions of the atmosphere are assumed to be fully saturated with water vapor due to evaporation from incoming pebbles. For low-mass planets, the saturated atmosphere extends down to the surface of an ocean that contains the bulk of the water budget. When temperatures are too high for an ocean to exist, the outer atmosphere is still saturated with water vapor, but the inner regions may be undersaturated (if insufficient water is available), or above the critical temperature for water.</p>

We assume that the water becomes intimately mixed with the hydrogen and helium throughout the resulting atmosphere. (In practice, some mixing may occur when the ocean is slightly below the critical temperature, but we do not attempt to model this effect here.) Below a particular transition temperature, the atmosphere is saturated in water vapor. Above this temperature, we assume the water mass fraction is constant, and set by the total amount of water available (which is equal to the mass of the rocky core in the nominal model). For rocky core masses below 0.105 Earth masses, this transition occurs at or close to the critical point, while for more massive cores, the transition occurs at progressively lower temperatures.

(The changes in the temperature-pressure gradient seen at 2000 K and 3000 K in the lower, right panel of the figure are artifacts caused by changes in the EOS at these points.) The great majority of the atmospheric mass is contained in the region below 8.5 core radii, with only about 0.15% of the total planetary mass lying at larger radii.</p>

The top panel shows the rocky core mass as a function of the total planetary mass. The middle panel shows the gas (H plus He) mass fraction.

<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">For total masses below about 10 Earth masses, the rocky core mass increases roughly linearly with total mass. A growing planet should follow this trajectory, with the total mass increasing smoothly with core mass. Above 10 Earth masses, the curve in the top panel of Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3 Nominal Case ‣ Steamworlds: Atmospheric Structure and Critical Mass of Planets Accreting Icy Pebbles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> starts to turn over. Small increases in core mass lead to progressively larger increases in atmospheric mass and thus total mass. At a total mass of 17 Earth masses, the core mass reaches a maximum value of 3.03 Earth masses. At this point H and He represent about 64% of the total planetary mass.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Further increases in total mass result in a smaller core mass, before the core mass starts to increase again when the total mass reaches 20 Earth masses, eventually reaching a second maximum at a total mass of 50 Earth masses. In practice, the core mass should increase monotonically with time, so the region between 17 and 20 Earth masses is unphysical. It is possible that continued gas accretion will allow a real planet to move across this region before rejoining the solutions above 20 Earth masses. However, examining this possibility would require a model that includes time evolution and luminosity generated by gas accretion rather than the static model used here.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">It may seem surprising that a given core can support more than one type of atmosphere. However, the solutions differ in a number of respects. In particular, the luminosities are different because the capture radius for pebble accretion is determined by the total mass rather than the core mass. The atmospheric compositions are also different since a given mass of water is diluted to different degrees by the different masses of H/He gas for each atmospheric solution. We note that <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mizuno (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>)</cite> also found multiple atmospheric solutions for a given core mass. Here we follow <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Mizuno (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">1980</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Venturini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>, and associate the first core-mass maximum with the “critical” core mass, assuming that the static solutions become invalid beyond this point.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">A second criterion that is sometimes used to determine the onset of rapid gas accretion is the “crossover” mass <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Pollack et al. (<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>); Rafikov (<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. This is the point at which the masses of the core and atmosphere are equal. In the model presented here, the atmospheric mass is always greater than the core mass, once an ocean ceases to exist, due to the presence of water vapor. Instead, we note the point at which H and He make up half of the total mass. Using this criterion, rapid gas accretion in Figure <a href="#S3.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 3 Nominal Case ‣ Steamworlds: Atmospheric Structure and Critical Mass of Planets Accreting Icy Pebbles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> would begin at a core mass of 2.68 Earth masses, slightly below the critical mass.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">One of the biggest uncertainties in the model is the opacity of dust grains in the atmosphere. Some dust is swept into the atmosphere with the inflowing gas. The opacity of this dust will depend on the local dust-to-gas ratio in the protoplanetary disk, which in turn depends on how much dust was converted into pebbles. A bigger uncertainty is the fate of infalling pebbles once their icy component evaporates. The rocky residues may remain intact, settling quickly towards the core and leaving the opacity unchanged. Alternatively, pebbles may disintegrate into sub-<math id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mu" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">μ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜇</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS1.p1.1.m1.1c">\mu</annotation></semantics></math>m-size grains once the ice cementing these grains evaporates.

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The crossover mass doesn’t exhibit the complicated behavior shown by the critical mass, (The change of slope seen in the figure coincides with a change in the outer boundary condition from the Bondi radius to 1/4 of the Hill radius.) For this reason, the crossover mass may represent a more robust measure of the onset of rapid gas accretion than the critical mass. It is worth noting that the critical and crossover masses are similar for large dust opacities.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Overall, the core mass at the onset of rapid gas accretion tends to increase with increasing dust opacity. A higher opacity is associated with a steeper rise in temperature in the radiative region of the atmosphere. As a result, the boundary between the radiative and convective regions lies further from the core when the opacity is large. In the radiative region, pressure and density both increase roughly exponentially moving inwards, while these quantities vary more slowly in the convective part of the atmosphere (see Figure <a href="#S3.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 3 Nominal Case ‣ Steamworlds: Atmospheric Structure and Critical Mass of Planets Accreting Icy Pebbles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>). Since the total atmospheric mass depends on the integrated density, a smaller radiative region typically leads to a lower total mass for a given core mass, increasing the core mass needed for rapid gas accretion to begin.</p>

<p id="S4.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The mass flux of pebbles passing through the region containing the planet is another source of uncertainty. Pebble drift rates depend on the size of the pebbles and the radial pressure gradient in the disk. The pebble flux depends on the drift rate, and also on the total mass of pebbles in the disk, how long they have been drifting, and the radial extent of the disk. The pebble flux is likely to vary with time and location, possibly by large amounts. In our model, the luminosity of the planet’s atmosphere is determined by the pebble accretion rate, which depends on the pebble flux as well as the capture radius. Thus, we consider a range of possible pebble fluxes.</p>

<div id="S4.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">So far, we have considered changes that alter the structure of a planetary atmosphere’s outer, radiative zone via the opacity or luminosity. In this section, we examine differences caused by altering the ice-to-rock ratio of the pebbles accreted by the planet, which tends to affect the lower atmosphere. In the previous cases, we assumed that the ice mass fraction is 50%. However, other values are possible for the solar nebula and other protoplanetary disks. In the solar nebula for example, the ice-to-rock ratio is somewhat uncertain due to uncertainties in the carbon-to-oxygen ratio of the Sun, and uncertainties regarding the main carrier of carbon in the solar nebula <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Asplund et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>; Lodders, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">2003</a>)</cite>.</p>

Unlike the other model parameters, both the critical mass and crossover mass show a clear, nearly monotonic trend with ice fraction. The masses decline steadily with ice fraction for fractions less than about 0.65, falling from 8.1 Earth masses to about 2.4 Earth masses for the critical mass and 1.9 Earth masses for the crossover mass. At this point, the critical mass increases somewhat, before resuming the previous trend. The crossover mass declines monotonically with ice fraction for all values considered here.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The strong dependence of the critical mass on the ice fraction comes from the fact that the atmospheric mass depends on the mean molecular weight, and this is greater when large amounts of water are present. When the mean molecular weight is high, the atmospheric mass is larger for a given core mass, leading to a smaller critical mass. This is true only in the hot inner regions however. The effect seen in Figure <a href="#S4.F9" title="Figure 9 ‣ 4.3 Dependence on Pebble Size ‣ 4 Critical Core Mass ‣ Steamworlds: Atmospheric Structure and Critical Mass of Planets Accreting Icy Pebbles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a> would be even stronger if the amount of water in the outer atmosphere wasn’t restricted by the saturation pressure of water.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we have examined the growth and atmospheric structure of planets accreting ice-rich pebbles in a protoplanetary disk of H and He gas. Such planets pass through several evolutionary stages, as shown in Figure <a href="#S2.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 2 The Model ‣ Steamworlds: Atmospheric Structure and Critical Mass of Planets Accreting Icy Pebbles" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, beginning with objects too small to appreciably affect the gas in the surrounding disk. When the planet’s mass reaches about 0.002 Earth masses, it begins to acquire an atmosphere. The atmospheric mass increases rapidly with increasing core mass. The outer regions are optically thin and nearly isothermal, while close to the core temperatures increase rapidly and a convective zone develops.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Incoming pebbles sediment slowly towards the core at terminal velocity. As they encounter warmer regions, the icy component of the pebbles begins to evaporate, saturating the atmosphere with water vapor. Excess water and ice precipitate towards the core, forming an ocean when the surface temperature and pressure exceed the triple point of water. For the model parameters used here, an ocean first forms when the mass of rock reaches about 0.04 Earth masses. In the convective region, water vapor in the saturated gas condenses as the gas rises and cools. The condensed water precipitates back to the ocean, while the latent heat released by condensation means that the rising gas follows a shallow, moist-adiabatic temperature profile.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">When the rocky core mass reaches about 0.08 Earth masses, the temperature becomes too high for an ocean to exist. We assume that water in the region closest to the rocky core forms a super-critical convecting fluid that mixes with gas in the layers above. Temperatures decline with distance from the core, passing smoothly through the critical point of water. The outer part of the convective zone continues to follow a moist adiabat. However, the higher temperatures in the inner part of the convective zone mean that the gas is undersaturated in water vapor, and here the temperature profile follows a steeper dry adiabat. It is possible that water from the ocean doesn’t fully mix with the gas in the layers above when the ocean boils due to the steep molecular weight gradient. However, this probably won’t make much difference to the outcome since the planetary mass at this stage is much lower than the critical mass. The amount of water that remains trapped in such a “core” is much less than the water supplied by more infalling pebbles, and this additional water will be mixed with gas in the convecting region of the atmophere.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p4.1" class="ltx_p">As the core mass increases beyond 0.08 Earth masses in our model, the atmospheric mass continues to grow, and the mass ratio of water vapor to gas decreases. The region of the atmosphere that is saturated and convecting becomes increasingly narrow as a result. At a core mass of a few Earth masses, 50% of the total planetary mass is made up of H and He gas. At a slightly higher mass, the rocky core mass reaches a maximum, and we assume the static model used here ceases to be valid at this point. Presumably, rapid gas accretion will begin to take place at around this critical mass, eventually forming a gas-giant planet.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The critical mass often exhibits complicated behavior as a function of the main model parameters. This is due to the existence of multiple maxima in the relation between total mass and core mass. A more robust indicator of the onset rapid gas accretion may be the crossover mass (defined here as the point when 50% of the planet’s mass is H and He), since this typically varies in a simpler manner when the parameters are varied. Better estimates of the onset of rapid gas accretion will come from evolving models that include the energy released due to gas accretion.</p>

<p id="S5.p8.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we find larger critical core masses, typically a few Earth masses, even though large amounts of water are present due to the evaporation of ice from pebbles. There are several reasons for this difference.

Here, we calculate the luminosity self-consistently based on the pebble accretion rate, typically yielding slightly higher values at the critical mass.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p9.1" class="ltx_p">However, the main reason for the larger critical masses found here is that we consider atmospheres with water mass fractions that vary considerably with altitude due to precipitation. Temperatures in the outer, radiative region are only slightly higher than in the local protoplanetary disk. As a result, the saturation pressure and mass fraction of water vapor are very low in this region. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Venturini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> assumed that condensed ice and water would remain where it forms, presumably in the form of clouds. We believe this is unlikely, particularly for the large water mass fractions they considered, and that most of the condensed water will precipitate to the ocean or undersaturated regions deeper in the atmosphere. In fact, if mixing in the radiative region is inefficient, the water abundance may always be small since incoming pebbles will not evaporate where the gas is saturated in water vapor.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p10.1" class="ltx_p">The very low abundance of water vapor in the upper atmosphere means that the radiative region and the upper convective region behave somewhat like the corresponding regions in conventional models for core accretion that consider a solar mixture of gases dominated by H and He, and yield large critical core masses <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pollack et al., <a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">1996</a>; Movshovitz et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>. The presence of higher water fractions deep in the atmosphere clearly reduces the critical core mass, as can be seen in Figure 9, but the effect is more modest than found by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hori &amp; Ikoma (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Venturini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. One difference between the conventional models and the one described here is that we assume that convection in the outer atmosphere begins when the temperature gradient reaches a moist adiabat, which is typically shallower than the dry adiabat that is usually considered. As a result, the radiative-convective boundary lies at a higher altitude in the model described here, raising the critical mass somewhat. Overall, however, previous estimates of the critical mass based on H- and He-dominated atmospheres may still be reasonably valid when the effect of ice evaporation from pebbles is taken into account.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p11" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p11.1" class="ltx_p">In our model, two sources of negative feedback act to raise the critical mass even as the core itself grows. Firstly, an increase in the planetary mass increases the luminosity of the atmosphere, both because the capture cross section for pebbles becomes larger, and because the gravitational energy released by each infalling pebble becomes greater as the core’s potential well deepens. Secondly, as the planet grows, the water-to-gas ratio in the atmosphere declines. Thus, the density effect due to water vapor is increasingly diluted, and the presence of water vapor becomes less important for the structure of the atmosphere. Both factors need to be taken into account when determining the onset of rapid gas accretion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p12" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p12.1" class="ltx_p">In this study, we have considered only a single volatile species heavier than He, namely water. The rationale for this choice is that we consider a planet located just beyond the ice line that is accreting pebbles. While large planetesimals in this region may retain other, more-volatile ices, these ices will surely have evaporated from pebble-size particles before they encounter the planet. One possibility not considered here is that protoplanetary disks may contain an appreciable mass of tar-like organic compounds <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lodders, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite>, which are intermediate in volatility between water ice and rock. Such tars would be present in pebbles just outside the ice line, but would evaporate in the hotter regions of the planet’s atmosphere. The presence of large amounts of tar-like material could alter the atmospheric structure and introduce some of the effects found by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Hori &amp; Ikoma (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">Venturini et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Furthermore, the high temperatures we find close to the core of the planet may be sufficient for rocky materials to evaporate and decompose rather than sedimenting to the core as we have assumed here. These possibilities are worth studying further in future.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p13" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p13.1" class="ltx_p">Some other factors may warrant further study. For example, the current model considers a constant mass flux of pebbles passing through the protoplanetary disk, and uses a fixed Stokes number for these pebbles. Neither quantity is likely to be constant in real disks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Birnstiel et al., <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. The pebble flux probably declines over time, and the typical pebble size is likely to decrease as big pebbles are preferentially lost due to radial drift. Both factors will decrease the pebble capture rate and luminosity of the planet over time. Another factor we have not considered here is that the supply of pebbles may be shut off entirely once the planet becomes massive enough to alter the sign of the radial pressure gradient in nearby regions of the disk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lambrechts et al., <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p14" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p14.1" class="ltx_p">In addition, we have assumed that the temperature and density at the outer boundary of the planet remain fixed. These quantities could change over time as the disk evolves or the planet migrates through the disk. Previous works have noted that the critical core mass is insensitive to the outer boundary conditions provided that the outer atmosphere is radiative <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Stevenson, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">1982</a>; Rafikov, <a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>. However, this will no longer be true if the outer boundary crosses the condensation front for a major species such as the ice line, since the composition of infalling pebbles will change abruptly at this point. In particular, a planet moving inwards across the ice line may change from a situation in which there is a net gain of water to a net loss as the water fraction in the outer atmosphere increases above the local disk value.</p>
