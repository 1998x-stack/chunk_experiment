<p id="id14.id1" class="ltx_p">It is known that unconfined dust explosions consist of a relatively weak primary (turbulent) deflagrations followed by a devastating secondary explosion. The secondary explosion may propagate with a speed of up to 1000 m/s producing overpressures of over 8-10 atm. Since detonation is the only established theory that allows a rapid burning producing a high pressure that can be sustained in open areas, the generally accepted view was that the mechanism explaining the high rate of combustion in dust explosions is deflagration to detonation transition. In the present work we propose a theoretical substantiation of the alternative propagation mechanism explaining origin of the secondary explosion producing the high speeds of combustion and high overpressures in unconfined dust explosions. We show that clustering of dust particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a significant increase of the thermal radiation absorption length ahead of the advancing flame front. This effect ensures that clusters of dust particles are exposed to and heated by the radiation from hot combustion products of large gaseous explosions sufficiently long time to become multi-point ignition kernels in a large volume ahead of the advancing flame front. The ignition times of fuel-air mixture by the radiatively heated clusters of particles is considerably reduced compared to the ignition time by the isolated particle. The radiation-induced multi-point ignitions of a large volume of fuel-air ahead of the primary flame efficiently increase the total flame area, giving rise to the secondary explosion, which results in high rates of combustion and overpressures required to account for the observed level of overpressures and damages in unconfined dust explosions, such as e.g. the 2005 Buncefield explosion and several vapor cloud explosions of severity similar to that of the Buncefield incident.</p>

Explosions initiated by these mixtures have destroyed infrastructure in mines and have taken thousands of lives in the past. Faraday and Lyell, who in 1845 analyzed <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite> one of the most destructive coal mine explosions, the one in the Haswell coal mine, had been the first who pointed to the likely key role of dust particles. In the real world, the types and nature of dust explosions are diverse. Devastating dust explosions can occur in a system of the combustible or inert particles suspended in fuel-air.
The catastrophic Aluminium particles dust explosions is another example of devastating explosions, occurred on August 2014 in a large industrial plant in Kunshan, China), where 75 people were killed and 185 were injured <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Dust explosions can be either partly or fully confined (e.g. explosions of pulverized bio-mass plants), or unconfined. In majority of the large-scale vapor cloud explosions (VCEs) there was clear forensic evidence that a severe explosion had propagated into open uncongested areas. This was a feature of all of the large vapor cloud incidents for which detailed primary evidence was available, e.g., the 2005 Buncefield fuel storage depot explosion), and several VCEs of severity similar to that of the Buncefield, which occurred during past decade <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>.
Unconfined dust explosions and VCEs start with a primary accidentally ignited flame in the deflagration regime. In majority of dust explosions the primary flame becomes turbulent due to obstacles in the flame propagation path, which can significantly enhance the flame propagation speed.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Historically, large-scale chemical explosions that involve a fuel (methane, propane or butane) mixed with the atmosphere were considered as unconfined dust explosions. Admittedly, a large-scale coal mine explosions share traits with the large vapor cloud incidents and may be considered as either partly or almost fully unconfined dust explosions.
Large-scale and unconfined dust explosions and VCEs start with a primary accidentally ignited flame in the deflagration regime. In majority of dust explosions, the primary flame becomes turbulent due to obstacles in the flame propagation path, which can significantly enhance the flame propagation speed. A dust explosion occurs when the dust particles are dispersed in the fuel-air ahead of the advancing flame.
In real explosions it is common for the pressure waves from the primary ignited flame to disturb dust on the ground ahead of the flame front, so a dust explosion occurs when the dust particles are entrained and
dispersed in the fuel-air. However, despite considerable efforts over more than 100 years, the mechanism governing flame propagation in dust explosions that cause an extremely high combustion speeds and overpressures, required to account for the levels of observed damage, still remains a major unresolved issue. Currently most prevention and safety methods rely on empirical correlations. Although the technology for preventing dust explosions has progressed considerably, recurring accidents in the mining industries and fuel storages (VCEs) call for a fundamentally improved understanding of the mechanism of the flame propagation and the origin of high overpressures in these explosions.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The conventional flame propagation mechanisms in the deflagration regime cannot cause high overpressures and explain the observed level of damages such as, e.g. in the Buncefield incident. Since detonation is the only established theory that allows sufficiently rapid burning while producing a high pressure that can be sustained in open areas, this led many researchers to conjecture (see e.g. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>) that deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) following turbulent flame acceleration is the mechanism that explains the high rate of combustion and overpressures and the observed damages in dust explosions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Already from the early experimental studies of the deflagration to detonation transition in ducts <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> it was known that the flame accelerates more rapidly if it passes through an array of turbulence-generating baffles. Turbulence acts as a perturbing force, increasing the flame surface and the overall burning rate. Channels with rough walls and obstacles are often used to study DDT, since in this case the run-up distance is better controlled
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>. This was presumably the reason why the first attempts to explain DDT were heavily based on the assumption that DDT might occur only if the flame becomes turbulent, and that turbulence is the primary reason for the flame acceleration. At the same time, already at the beginning of DDT studies, Ya. B. Zeldovich <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> has convincingly shown that stretching of the flame front due to the interaction with a nonuniform upstream flow velocity field in the boundary layer is the main process of the flame acceleration, while turbulence plays a supplementary role. Stretching of the flame front by the sheared flow is much stronger mechanism of the flame acceleration, than the flame front wrinkling caused by turbulence. Indeed, DDT was observed experimentally in a smooth tube for different highly reactive mixtures, e.g. hydrogen-oxygen or ethylene–oxygen
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. It was shown theoretically and by using numerical simulations
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>, that transition to detonation occurs,
if the flame sufficiently accelerates in the flow behind the leading shock wave, so that it can catch up the leading shock and the positive feedback between the shock and the rate of chemical reaction of the flame may lead to transition to detonation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Deflagration-to-detonation transition in unconfined systems is more problematic. The process is scale dependent, therefore the investigations in a small laboratory scales cannot reveal this phenomenon. The run-up distance for transition to detonation increases with the transverse tube diameter. For a channel with repeated obstacles the run-up distance is of the order or larger than (10-20) of the tube diameters. The experimental evidence for the increased turbulent flame speeds, were reported in large-scale congested space for various highly reactive fuels in air (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, and references therein). According to experimental studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>, the critical tube diameter, for which transition to detonation in methane-air can occur, should be not less than 9.5 m, and the transition can occur at the run up distance exceeding 100-150 m.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In the recent theoretical and numerical models possible mechanism of DDT in truly unconfined systems is attributed to the flame acceleration induced by the flame front wrinkling caused by
the flame hydrodynamic (DL) instability <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib31" title="" class="ltx_ref">31</a>]</cite>
or turbulence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>.
On the other hand, numerical simulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> demonstrated that possible DDT in unconfined media, caused by the flame interactions with turbulence, is feasible only for a very large turbulent velocities.
In general, theoretical models whose purpose is to explain possible mechanisms of DDT in unconfined systems led to a deeper understanding of the effects of shocks, turbulence, and other mechanisms of flame acceleration on creating the conditions in which DDT could occur. Nonetheless, even though these studies advanced basic understanding, they opened up more questions than it answered. It is also possible that in dust explosions the additional flame acceleration due to radiative preheating can promote DDT in unconfined systems, though this would require a special investigation, which is outside the scope of the present study.</p>

<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The possibility that DDT occurs in vapor cloud explosions in industrial accidents has generally only been recognized in the experiments for highly reactive fuels, such as hydrogen and ethylene, and the corresponding models has been validated against a range of experimental data, obtained from a laboratory-scale experiments.
Applying it to industrial accidents
is taking the models beyond its validation range, where they cannot be used as a predictive tool. In particular, in the case of the Buncefield and similar VCE incidents, the extent and density of congestion are substantially less than that required for DDT.</p>

sufficiently examined so far. The impact of thermal radiation emanated by the advancing flame in large dust explosions can be expected with a range of possible outcomes. Particles suspended in an initially flammable gas mixture heated by thermal radiation,
in turn, heat the surrounding gas and
can enhance the flame speed and cause ignition of the surrounding fuel-air mixture. This effect can play an important role in the large dust explosions and VCEs. In unconfined dust explosions the radiative flux emitted from the advancing flame into the reactants is significantly enhanced by the increased emissivity of the large volume of burned products with hot particles.

the forward radiative flux, emitted by hot combustion products in large gaseous explosions, is close to the blackbody radiation at stoichiometric flame temperatures (2200 – 2500 K).

The numerical simulations were performed in a way similar as it was done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> for a planar flame propagating in a particle-laden combustible gas mixture. The governing equations for the gaseous phase are the one-dimensional, time-dependent, multispecies reactive Navier-Stokes equations including the effects of compressibility, molecular diffusion, thermal conduction, viscosity and detailed chemical kinetics for the reactive species, production of radicals, energy release and heat transfer between the particles and the gas. The dynamics of solid particles is considered in continuous hydrodynamic approximation. The interaction between particles is assumed negligibly small for a small volumetric concentration of particles, so that only the Stokes force between the particle and gaseous phase is taken into account
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib39" title="" class="ltx_ref">39</a>, <a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite>. The high temperature of the particle-laden mixture behind the flame front is considered optically-thick so that the radiation energy flux emitted from the flame is assumed to be equal to the blackbody radiative heat source. The initial velocity of the flame was taken to be normal laminar flame velocity with the temperature of the mixture
ahead of the flame being 300 K.
Time evolution in numerical simulations was studied up to establishing of the steady state for radiatively heated mixture ahead of the flame and the flame speed.</p>

<p id="S3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Possibility of ignition depends on the level of thermal radiation
absorbed by the particles, which must be heated to sufficiently high temperatures. In the case of evenly dispersed particles radiation is absorbed by particles in the nearest layers ahead of the flame front, and its intensity decreases exponentially.
Therefore, there is no enough time for particles to be heated up to the level sufficient for ignition of surrounding gas mixture.
The situation is completely different when particles are non-uniformly dispersed, for example, in the form of the optically thick dust layer separated from ahead of the flame front by the gaseous gap with sufficiently small concentration of particles in the gap. In this case the gap between the flame and the layer is transparent for radiation, and particles in the layer are sufficiently long time exposed to and heated by the radiation from the flame to become ignition kernels. It was shown <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib40" title="" class="ltx_ref">40</a>]</cite> that such optically thick layer of particles can ignite a new combustion wave in the surrounding fuel-air mixture ahead of the flame front before it is reached by the advancing flame.</p>

<div id="S3.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In practical dust explosion incidents, the plausibility of formation of ignition kernels ahead of the flame is determined by the absorption (penetration) length of radiation and ignition timescales. This is because particles well ahead of the flame front have to be exposed to and sufficiently long time heated by thermal radiation in order to ignite surrounding mixture. We will show that clustering of particles in a turbulent flow gives rise to a strong, up to 2–3 order of magnitude, increase of the radiation penetration length. The time of ignition of a fuel-air mixture by clusters of particles is also considerably reduced, as compared with the ignition time for the isolated radiatively heated particle. The proposed mechanism of the multi-point radiation-induced ignitions due to the turbulent clustering of particles, may explain the occurrence of the secondary explosion regardless of whether the particles are combustible or unreactive.</p>

The turbulent eddies, acting as small centrifuges, push the particles to the regions between the eddies, where the pressure fluctuations are maximum and the vorticity intensity is minimum. Therefore, suspended small particles in a turbulent flow tend to assemble in clusters with much higher particle number densities than the mean particle number density. This effect, known as inertial clustering, has been investigated in a number of analytical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>, <a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>, <a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>, <a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>]</cite>, numerical <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>, <a href="#bib.bib52" title="" class="ltx_ref">52</a>]</cite>, and experimental <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">53</a>, <a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">54</a>, <a href="#bib.bib55" title="" class="ltx_ref">55</a>, <a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>]</cite> studies.</p>

This causes correlations between fluctuations of fluid temperature and velocity, and non-zero correlations between fluctuations of pressure and fluid velocity. This enhances the particle clustering in the regions of maximum pressure fluctuations. As a result, the particle concentration in clusters rises by a few orders of magnitude, as compared to the mean concentration of evenly dispersed particles <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>, <a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>]</cite>.</p>

The effect of an increase in the radiation transmission through gas-particle mixtures caused by the inertial particle clustering in non-stratified turbulence was studied using a Monte Carlo model in different particle distributions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib63" title="" class="ltx_ref">63</a>, <a href="#bib.bib64" title="" class="ltx_ref">64</a>]</cite>. In the case of the non-stratified turbulence and for relatively small Reynolds numbers both effects: the particle clustering and the increase of the radiation absorption length are not very pronounced. On the contrary, in the case of a dust explosion, there are many reasons for the formation of an inhomogeneous temperature distribution and temperature gradients in the turbulent flow produced by pressure waves ahead of the primary flame. We will show that the clustering of particles in the temperature stratified turbulence ahead of the primary flame gives rise to a strong increase of the radiation penetration length. The effect ensures that the inequality (<a href="#S3.E2" title="In 3 Effect of the radiative preheating ‣ Multipoint Radiation Induced Ignition of Dust Explosions: Turbulent Clustering of Particles and Increased Transparency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>) is satisfied because clusters of particles even far ahead of the primary flame are sufficiently long time exposed and heated by the radiation from the primary flame to become ignition kernels.</p>

There are two physical effects related to particle clustering which affect the radiative transfer: (i) formation of the transparent for radiation
windows between particle clusters, and
(ii) screening of particles inside the clusters from the radiation for optically thick clusters.
The analysis performed in the present study yields the effective absorption coefficient, <math id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\kappa_{\rm eff}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><msub id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml">κ</mi><mi id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml">eff</mi></msub><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.2">𝜅</ci><ci id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.3">eff</ci></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">\kappa_{\rm eff}</annotation></semantics></math>, that takes into account the collective effects of turbulent clusters

the screening effect for optically thick clusters.

However, in the case of isothermal turbulence the rate of the particle clustering is rather low. It is more than order of magnitude less than the rate of the particle clustering for a temperature stratified turbulence (see Figure 1 in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib57" title="" class="ltx_ref">57</a>]</cite>). Therefore, for isothermal turbulence the density of particles in clusters is unlikely to increase significantly. In this case, clusters either do not survive for a long time, or they are absorbed by the advancing flame long before the density of particles in clusters can increase significantly.

<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Analysis performed in the previous section shows that clustering of particles in the temperature stratified turbulent flow ahead of the primary flame may increase the radiation penetration length up to 2–3 orders of magnitude (see Figure <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4.3 Effective penetration length of radiation ‣ 4 Effect of turbulent clustering of dust particles on the radiation heat transfer ‣ Multipoint Radiation Induced Ignition of Dust Explosions: Turbulent Clustering of Particles and Increased Transparency" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>).
This effect ensures that clusters of particles, are exposed to and heated by the radiation from the primary flame for sufficiently long time to become ignition kernels in a large volume ahead of the flame. The multi-point radiation-induced ignition of the surrounding fuel-air increases effectively the total flame area, so the distance, which each flame has to cover for a complete burn-out of the fuel, is substantially reduced. It results in a strong increase of the effective combustion speed, defined as the rate of reactant consumption of a given volume, and overpressures, required to account for the observed level of damages in unconfined dust explosions. If, for example, the radiation absorption length of evenly dispersed particles with spatial mass density 0.03 kg/m<sup id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_sup">3</sup> was in the range of a few centimeters, dust particles assembled in the
clusters of particles, are sufficiently heated by radiation at distances up to 10–20 m ahead of the advancing flame.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The present study has shown that the mechanism of the secondary explosion in unconfined dust explosions and large vapor cloud explosions can be explained by the turbulent clustering of dust particles. The latter include the effect of considerable increase of the radiation penetration length, the formation of ignition kernels into the turbulent flow caused by the primary flame, and the subsequent formation of the secondary explosions, which is caused by the impact of forward thermal radiation. The mechanism of multi-point radiation-induced ignitions due to the turbulent clustering of particles ensures that ignition of the gas mixture by the radiatively-heated clusters occurs rapidly and within a large volume ahead of the primary flame.</p>

<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The described picture of the unsteady combustion consisting of the rapid combustion producing high overpressures, which is punctuated by subsequent slow combustion, is well consistent with <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> analysis of the Buncefield explosion. Although details of the real physical processes can be different, the proposed theoretical model describes the observed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> episodic nature of combustion in dust explosions, and more importantly it captures the most important relevant physics.

It should be emphasized that the effect of the strong increase of the radiation penetration length due to turbulent clustering of particles goes beyond the dust explosion applications and has many implications in astrophysical and atmospheric turbulence <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">[<a href="#bib.bib58" title="" class="ltx_ref">58</a>, <a href="#bib.bib72" title="" class="ltx_ref">72</a>, <a href="#bib.bib73" title="" class="ltx_ref">73</a>]</cite>.</p>
