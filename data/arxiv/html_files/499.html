<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We formulate and prove a generalized Albanese property for families of maps from a smooth curve over an arbitrary field into a commutative group stack. Our proof, which is mostly self-contained, employs local-to-global techniques and some new Ext-vanishing results to reduce to the local Cartier self-duality theorem of Contou-Carrére. As a corollary, we reprove local and global geometric class field theory with arbitrary ramification.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Modern geometric class field theory has its origins in the work of Lang and Rosenlicht in the 1950s, summarized in the book by Serre <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite>. They reproved Artin reciprocity for function fields using methods from algebraic geometry, emphasizing the role of the Albanese property enjoyed by the Jacobian variety of an algebraic curve.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Later, Deligne and Serre reinterpreted geometric class field theory in terms of étale local systems, so that it could be formulated for curves over any field. The Artin reciprocity isomorphism for function fields over a finite ground field can be recovered from their formulation by passing through the <em id="S1.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">faisceaux-fonctions</em> correspondence. Deligne gave a beautiful geometric proof of the global unramified case, which is to say for local systems on a smooth projective curve (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> for an account). After some modification his argument applies to the tamely ramified case (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>), and recently has been extended to allow arbitrary ramification (<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Meanwhile, local geometric class field theory is not particularly well-documented in the literature. Serre <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> gave an approach to local class field theory for a complete non-archimedean field with algebraically closed residue field of positive characteristic, which was generalized by Hazewinkel <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> to allow any perfect residue field of positive characteristic, and later Suzuki and Yoshida <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite> extended this to an arbitrary perfect residue field (see also <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite>). This approach has a geometric flavor, with the group of local units in some sense playing the role of local Jacobian. However, the arguments are arithmetic in nature, relying on Galois cohomology and related techniques.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_runin ltx_font_bold ltx_title_subsection">1.2   The generalized Albanese property.</h3>

<div id="S1.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we formulate and prove a generalized Albanese property in the spirit of Lang and Rosenlicht, valid for maps from a smooth curve over any field into a rather general kind of commutative group stack, which is required only to satisfy a reflexivity property with respect to Cartier duality (Corollary <a href="#S2.SS2.Thmtheorem1.Thmcorollary1" title="Corollary 2.2.1.1. ‣ 2.2 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2.1.1</span></a>). As a consequence, we obtain a strong form of geometric class field theory <em id="S1.SS2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">á là</em> Deligne, allowing local systems with arbitrary ramification (Corollary <a href="#S2.SS4.Thmtheorem1.Thmcorollary1" title="Corollary 2.4.1.1. ‣ 2.4 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4.1.1</span></a>). The Albanese property applies to families of maps over an arbitrary base; in fact, this is crucial for our proof (we work with a curve defined over the ground field, but our methods should extend to the case of a relative curve without too much difficulty).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Cartier duality plays a key role in our approach. Namely, when the target stack is taken to be the classifying stack of the multiplicative group, the generalized Albanese property amounts to a perfect pairing between the Picard stack of the open curve (suitably interpreted) and the stack classifying line bundles on its projective closure with full level structure at the punctures (Theorem <a href="#S2.SS2.Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 2.2.1. ‣ 2.2 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.2.1</span></a>). Our proof of the Albanese property in general proceeds by reduction to this case.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Although many special cases were previously known, and the subject is an old one, our main result appears to be new. One possible explanation for this is that the generalized Albanese property for open curves is subtle to formulate in families. The obstruction can be seen in some examples constructed by Bass in 1962 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, which show that a family of line bundles on an open curve need not extend to its projective closure, even locally on the base. We overcome this difficulty, essentially by systematically excluding such non-extendable families of line bundles. In addition, we show that our Albanese property specializes to the naïve one when the target is a commutative affine group scheme or the classifying stack of a finite abelian group.</p>

<section id="S1.SS3" class="ltx_subsection">
<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_runin ltx_font_bold ltx_title_subsection">1.3   Methods.</h3>

<div id="S1.SS3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We begin by establishing a local Cartier self-duality theorem (Theorem <a href="#S2.SS3.Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 2.3.1. ‣ 2.3 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.3.1</span></a>) in the style of Contou-Carrère <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> using the theory of Tate vector bundles and the Beilinson-Kapranov determinant gerbe (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>,<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> for background on these notions; this approach is compared to Contou-Carrère’s in Appendix <a href="#A1" title="Appendix A The ramified local Abel-Jacobi map ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A</span></a>). Our result strengthens Contou-Carrère’s by also proving that any family of multiplicative line bundles on the group of local units is trivial locally on the base. In fact, we prove a similar vanishing statement for an arbitrary commutative affine group scheme, which surprisingly seems to be new even for the additive group, although many other cases were known previously (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>).</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Our proof of the local self-duality theorem is carried out factorizably, meaning we consider several points of the curve simultaneously and allow them to move and collide. This allows us to use local-to-global methods when proving the global Cartier self-duality theorem. The other main input for the global theorem is the fact that any family of multiplicative line bundles on the group of global invertible rational functions is trivial locally on the base (Lemma <a href="#S6.SS4.Thmtheorem2" title="Lemma 6.4.2. ‣ 6.4 ‣ 6 The unramified global Albanese property ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.4.2</span></a>; see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite> Proposition 4.9.1 for a closely related statement). The proof of this global vanishing result in <em id="S1.SS3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">loc. cit.</em> contains a gap, which we address following a suggestion made by Beilinson to the first-named author.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">As previously mentioned, we also show that our formulation of the generalized Albanese property implies geometric class field theory with arbitrary ramification (Theorem <a href="#S2.SS4.Thmtheorem1" title="Theorem 2.4.1. ‣ 2.4 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4.1</span></a>). The content of this implication is that any family of torsion line bundles on the open curve extends to its projective completion locally on the base. As we explain in Section <a href="#S9" title="9 Geometric class field theory ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">9</span></a>, this follows from recent results of Bouthier and Česnavičius <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="ltx_title ltx_runin ltx_font_bold ltx_title_subsection">1.4   Relation to previous work.</h3>

<div id="S1.SS4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In addition to the above-cited works, the formulation of our main theorem was inspired by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite>, where a version of the generalized Albanese property is proved in the unramified setting (i.e. for a projective curve). Their hypotheses on the target commutative group stack are rather complicated and seem to be less general than ours, although we are uncertain of the precise relation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS4.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Contou-Carrère proved a version of the Albanese property for an open curve in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, allowing families of maps into a smooth commutative group scheme. His approach, although different from ours, also emphasizes the role of Cartier duality.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Our approach has also been influenced by Mirković’s conjectural inner homology theory in algebraic geometry (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>). Specifically, he has proposed dual homology and cohomology theories on the category of (ind)-schemes with values in commutative group stacks which refine the usual singular theories. Our formulation of geometric class field theory, and in particular the generalized Albanese property, may be viewed as saying that the value of his cohomology theory on a curve is the Picard stack. In particular, the ramified duality statement may be construed as a version of Poincare duality between compactly supported cohomology and homology. One may adopt a similar perspective locally by thinking of the affine Grassmannian as the compactly supported cohomology of a disc.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS4.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Let us also comment on the relationship with the geometric Langlands program. Although geometric class field theory can be viewed as a special case of the geometric Langlands correspondence, proposed proofs of the latter (see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite> for a proof sketch in the de Rham setting) take class field theory as an input via the theory of geometric Eisenstein series. Thus the geometric Langlands program does not so much subsume geometric class field theory as rely on it.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">We became aware of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite> during the preparation of this manuscript. They both prove versions of our Corollary <a href="#S2.SS4.Thmtheorem1.Thmcorollary1" title="Corollary 2.4.1.1. ‣ 2.4 ‣ 2 Statement of results ‣ Geometric class field theory and Cartier duality" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.4.1.1</span></a>: Takeuchi proves the isomorphism at the level of geometric points, and Guignard in families (even for a relative curve). Their methods are quite different from ours.</p>
