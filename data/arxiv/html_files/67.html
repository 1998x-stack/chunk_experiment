<p id="id1.1a" class="ltx_p">Action completion detection is the problem of modelling the action’s progression towards localising the <span id="id1.1a.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">moment</span> of completion - when the action’s goal is confidently considered achieved. In this work, we assess the ability of two temporal models, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), to localise completion for six object interactions: <span id="id1.1a.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">switch, plug, open, pull, pick</span> and <span id="id1.1a.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">drink</span>. We use a supervised approach, where annotations of <span id="id1.1a.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-completion</span> and <span id="id1.1a.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> frames are available per action, and fine-tuned CNN features are used to train temporal models.
Tested on the Action-Completion-2016 dataset from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, we detect completion within 10 frames of annotations for <math id="id1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="id1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="id1.1.m1.1.1" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="id1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="id1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="id1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="id1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>75% of completed action sequences using both temporal models.

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Introduction</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">An action is defined, based on the Oxford dictionary, as <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the fact or process of doing something, typically to achieve an aim</span>.
Previous works on action recognition from visual data have overlooked assessing whether the action’s <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aim</span> has actually been achieved, rather than merely attempted.
Similarly, action localisation approaches detect the start and the end of an action’s attempt, without assessing whether the <span id="S1.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aim</span> has been successfully achieved.
The notion of assessing completion was introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>
where the performance of a variety of hand-crafted RGB-D features to distinguish between complete and incomplete sequences was reported, using a binary classifier which was learnt per action.
However, the approach in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> considered the sequence as a whole and classified it as either complete or incomplete.
In this work, we
closely examine the progression of the action and attempt to locate the <span id="S1.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">moment</span> in time when the action can indeed be considered completed. Temporal localisation of the moment of completion is a step towards an online approach that can detect completion once the action’s goal has been achieved.
Completion could prompt reminders or guidance for the next action.
For example, when preparing a food recipe, the user could be notified to wash the vegetables once these have been picked up.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Thus, we define the problem of ‘detecting the moment of completion’ as detecting the frame that separates <span id="S1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-completion</span> from <span id="S1.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> per sequence, when present.
Note that the ‘moment of completion’ is different from the typical ‘start’/‘end’ frames in action localisation. The former focuses on the action’s goal, while the latter focuses on the start and conclusion of any motion of relevance to the action.
Consider the action ‘drink’; the action is completed when the subject consumes some of the beverage from a cup or glass. Traditionally, localisation approaches locate the first movement of the hand as it lifts the cup up to the mouth, all the way to putting the cup down. Even if drinking does not actually take place, the start and end of the hand motion is localised. In contrast, the moment of completion is as soon as the subject actually drinks the beverage. The moment of completion cannot be localised when the action’s goal has not been completed.</p>

<figcaption class="ltx_caption ltx_centering"><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_figure">Figure 1: </span>Complete and incomplete sequences for action <span id="S1.F1.5.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">switch</span> are performed similarly up to the completion moment, after which an observer would confidently confirm completion. In this example, completion occurs as soon as the light is off. The <span id="S1.F1.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre</span>- and <span id="S1.F1.7.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> frames are shown in orange and purple bordering, respectively.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In detecting the moment of completion, we take a supervised approach, where we observe complete and incomplete sequences for the same action.
Up to the moment of completion, both complete and incomplete sequences would be similar, and an observer cannot confidently say if the action is going to be completed. The sequences differ after the completion takes place.
Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Detecting the Moment of Completion: Temporal Models for Localising Action Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> illustrates this notion using two sequences of action <span id="S1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">switch</span> from the dataset in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. In this example, our approach detects the moment the light is observed to be switched off, as the moment of completion - whereas in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> the aim was to label the entire sequence as complete/incomplete.
Completing an action makes changes in the scene which can be considered as visual cues for detecting completion. We propose an approach for completion detection in which these learnt signatures
are trained using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features along with a temporal model to encode the action’s evolution, similar to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
This approach is particularly useful for action/activity detection tasks, where the classification per frame depends not only on the observations of the current frame but also on the information passed from previous frames.
Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Long-Short Temporal Memory models (LSTMs) are two temporal models, suitable for dealing with sequential input data and capable of handling frame by frame analysis of an action sequence.
In this work, we compare HMM and LSTM for completion detection on six action classes.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We now present a brief review of related works in action recognition/detection and discuss which methods could be applied for completion detection.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Remarkable results for action recognition/detection have been achieved through extracting robust features, encoding them, then feeding them into classification methods <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. For example,  <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>, <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> extract space-time features from interest points or dense trajectories, encode them using BoWs or FVs, and then use SVM to recognise the actions. Such approaches do not model the temporal dynamics of actions explicitly, thus cannot provide per-frame detection.
Recently, CNN features of spatial and temporal information have been used for action recognition/detection using dual streams <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> or 3D convolutions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>.
A seminal work of Wang <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">et al.</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> encodes the transformations an action introduces to the scene from precondition into effect.
Although their approach is similar to ours, focussing on the changes that actions make into the scene, they perform action recognition without an explicit temporal encoding, which makes the approach unsuitable for frame level analysis or detecting the moment of completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Many recent works on action recognition/detection, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>, take advantage of CNN models to extract features from their last fully-connected layers in order to have a good representation of spatial information per frame. Then, they also train a temporal model on top of the extracted features to encode the dynamics of the action. This approach suits our completion detection task in two ways. First, extracting features from the CNN helps to encode the appearance changes in the scene. Second, it uses a temporal model and can provide per-frame decisions, while considering the context.
Two temporal models widely applied for action recognition/detection are HMMs and LSTMs.
HMM and its variants have been widely used in action recognition/detection to model temporal dynamics of actions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>, <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>]</cite>. For this purpose, an HMM model is usually trained per desired class. Then, the likelihood of a test sequence to belong to each model is evaluated and classification is performed by specifying the model which produces the maximum likelihood for the sequence.
To detect completion, we similarly learn a single supervised HMM model per action, with two hidden states <span id="S2.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-completion</span>/<span id="S2.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span>,
then use the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely label sequence.
LSTM, as another temporal model designed to deal with sequential information, is able to capture long-term dependencies in the input data, using the memory inside each cell.
In many recent works, LSTMs have achieved promising results for the task of action recognition/detection, such as <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>, <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>, <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The closest work to ours, <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, extracts skeletal features from depth data which are temporally encoded by Fourier temporal pyramid for recognising sequence-level completion. As they use a sequence-level representation, the method is not suitable for per-frame decisions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we go beyond sequence-level completion to, (i) achieve frame-level detection of the <span id="S2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">moment</span> of completion, (ii) show fine-tuned appearance features outperform pre-trained and previously used skeletal features for completion detection, (iii) report results on six actions from the previously introduced action completion dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, and (iv) compare per-action HMM and LSTM temporal models. Using fine-tuned appearance features, we detect the moment of completion for six different actions - within 10 frames - for 75.1% and 74.6% of the sequences by HMM and LSTM models, respectively.</p>

For hand-crafted features, we evaluate the best skeletal feature from <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, namely Joint-Velocities (JV), as well as the best raw-depth feature, namely Local Occupancy Patterns (LOP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>. We also test hand-crafted RGB features, namely Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). For CNN features, we use the “very deep VGG-16-layer” model <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>]</cite> trained on UCF101 action dataset <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, as pre-trained features.
We also fine-tune these models per action for two classes: <span id="S3.p2.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-completion</span> and <span id="S3.p2.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span>, using leave-one-subject-out.
Features are then extracted from the <span id="S3.p2.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">fc7</span> layer for both the pre-trained and fine-tuned CNNs.</p>

which contains both complete and incomplete sequences for the same action.

The results of comparing PCA-HMM with LSTM per action (using CNN features), are summarised in Table <a href="#S4.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Detecting the Moment of Completion: Temporal Models for Localising Action Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> and shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Detecting the Moment of Completion: Temporal Models for Localising Action Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>. Also, the combined results for all six actions in the dataset are shown in Fig. <a href="#S4.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 4 Experimental Results ‣ Detecting the Moment of Completion: Temporal Models for Localising Action Completion" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>. The figure shows that while LSTM detects completion more frequently - in fact completion is detected for 96.7% of the complete sequences using LSTM, compared to 88.5% using PCA-HMM,
LSTM is more likely to detect completion in incomplete sequences as well.
The slightly delayed detection by PCA-HMM could be because of its low transition probability (less than 1%) to go from <span id="S4.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-</span> to <span id="S4.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> state.
Also, it should be noted that, since LSTM does not learn any definite constraint on its transitions, it can transit back from <span id="S4.p8.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> to <span id="S4.p8.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-completion</span>, while PCA-HMM is forced to remain in <span id="S4.p8.1.6" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span>.
The results also show that action <span id="S4.p8.1.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">switch</span> is the nearest to the ground truth for both temporal models, which is due to the obvious change it introduces to the scene. In contrast, action <span id="S4.p8.1.8" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">open</span> has the worst performance, probably due to the subtle change it introduces to the environment.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper presents <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">action completion detection</span> as the task of localising the moment in time when a human observer believes an action’s goal has been achieved, for example an object has been picked up, or the light has been switched off. The approach goes beyond sequence-level recognition of completion towards frame level fine-grained perception of completion.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p2.1" class="ltx_p">We proposed a supervised approach for detecting completion per action. Fine-tuned CNN features were extracted per-frame and used to train temporal models. Two widely used temporal models, HMM and LSTM, were applied and their results were validated against the ground truth <span id="S5.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">pre-</span> and <span id="S5.p2.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">post-completion</span> labels. We showed that, for detecting completion, fine-tuned CNN features outperform pre-trained and hand-crafted features, as they capture the subtle changes in the scene when the action is completed. We also introduced a metric for completion detection to assess when completion is prematurely detected or when the decision is overdue. We showed that both temporal models (LSTM and PCA-HMM) can detect completion within 10 frames in

<p id="S5.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We aim to pursue two directions for future work.

Second, we aim to test the method on other datasets including a variety of actions for a wider understanding of action completion detection.</p>
