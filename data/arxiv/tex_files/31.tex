In this paper, we presented a dense initialization for quasi-Newton methods
to solve unconstrained optimization problems.  This initialization makes
use of two curvature estimates for the underlying function in two
complementary subspaces.  
Importantly, this initialization neither introduces additional
computational cost nor increases storage requirements; moreover,
it maintains theoretical convergence properties of quasi-Newton methods.
It should also be noted that this initialization still
makes it possible to efficiently compute products and perform solves with
the sequence of quasi-Newton matrices.  

The dense initialization is especially well-suited for use in the
shape-changing infinity-norm \LBFGS{} trust-region method. Numerical
results on the 
outperforms both the standard \LBFGS{} line search method as well as the
same shape-changing trust-region method with the conventional
initialization.  Use of this initialization is possible with any
quasi-Newton method for which the update has a compact representation.
While this initialization has broad applications for quasi-Newton line
search and trust-region methods, its use makes most sense from a
computational point of view when the quasi-Newton method already computes
the compact formulation and partial eigendecomposition; if this is not the
case, using the dense initialization will result in additional
computational expense that must be weighed against its benefits.
