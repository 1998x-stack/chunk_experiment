\section{Even-more write-efficient parallel algorithms}

\subsection{Connectivity and spanning trees}

Combining previous results should give us an algorithm with $O(m/p)$ work, $O(mp)$ writes, $O((\log n)/p)$ depth.

\subsection{Biconnected components and bridges}

In this section we show how to utilize the \implicit{} to find graph biconnected components (2-vertex connectivity) and bridges (1-edge connectivity) as examples in graph problems.




$q$ offline queries of biconnectivity and 1-edge connectivity can be answered in $O(m/p)$ work, $O(np+q)$ writes on expectation.

Online queries of biconnectivity and 1-edge connectivity can be answered in $O(m/p)$ preprocessing, $O(1/p^2)$ work on expectation or $O(1/{p^2\log n})$ w.h.p.\ per query, and no writes.

Hugely complicated.  Will go back and write more details later.
