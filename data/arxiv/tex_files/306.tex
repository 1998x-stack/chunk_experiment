  \caption{An example of the \imprep{} of a graph.  The spanning tree is rooted at vertex 1.  The solid and dot lines indicate tree edges while dot lines are the critical edges.  Dash lines are non-tree edges.  The vertex labels are $l=[1,1,1,2,1,1,3,3]$, and component heads $r=[1,2,6]$.
  Based on the \imprep{} the bridges, articulation points, and
  biconnected components can be easily retrieved as $\{(2,5)\}$,
  $\{2,6\}$, and $\{\{1,2,3,4,6,7\},\{2,5\},\{6,8,9\}\}$.
