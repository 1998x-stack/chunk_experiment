# Time Series Transformer

-   **last\_hidden\_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`) — Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the decoder of the model.
    
    If `past_key_values` is used only the last hidden-state of the sequences of shape `(batch_size, 1, hidden_size)` is output.
    
-   **past\_key\_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, _optional_, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) — Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.
    
    Contains pre-computed hidden-states (key and values in the self-attention blocks and in the cross-attention blocks) that can be used (see `past_key_values` input) to speed up sequential decoding.
    
-   **decoder\_hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, + one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.
    
    Hidden-states of the decoder at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
    
-   **decoder\_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.
    
    Attentions weights of the decoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention heads.
    
-   **cross\_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.
    
    Attentions weights of the decoder’s cross-attention layer, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the cross-attention heads.
    
-   **encoder\_last\_hidden\_state** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) — Sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder of the model.
    
-   **encoder\_hidden\_states** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings, if the model has an embedding layer, + one for the output of each layer) of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.
    
    Hidden-states of the encoder at the output of each layer plus the optional initial embedding outputs.
    
-   **encoder\_attentions** (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`) — Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, sequence_length)`.
    
    Attentions weights of the encoder, after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the self-attention heads.
    
-   **loc** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, input_size)`, _optional_) — Shift values of each time series’ context window which is used to give the model inputs of the same magnitude and then used to shift back to the original magnitude.
    
-   **scale** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size,)` or `(batch_size, input_size)`, _optional_) — Scaling values of each time series’ context window which is used to give the model inputs of the same magnitude and then used to rescale back to the original magnitude.
    
-   **static\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, feature size)`, _optional_) — Static features of each time series’ in a batch which are copied to the covariates at inference time.
