# ResNet

## Overview

The ResNet model was proposed in [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren and Jian Sun. Our implementation follows the small changes made by [Nvidia](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/resources/resnet_50_v1_5_for_pytorch), we apply the `stride=2` for downsampling in bottleneck‚Äôs `3x3` conv and not in the first `1x1`. This is generally known as ‚ÄúResNet v1.5‚Äù.

ResNet introduced residual connections, they allow to train networks with an unseen number of layers (up to 1000). ResNet won the 2015 ILSVRC & COCO competition, one important milestone in deep computer vision.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

_Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation._

Tips:

-   One can use [AutoImageProcessor](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoImageProcessor) to prepare images for the model.

## ResNetConfig

### class transformers.ResNetConfig

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/resnet/configuration_resnet.py#L35)

( num\_channels = 3embedding\_size = 64hidden\_sizes = \[256, 512, 1024, 2048\]depths = \[3, 4, 6, 3\]layer\_type = 'bottleneck'hidden\_act = 'relu'downsample\_in\_first\_stage = Falseout\_features = Noneout\_indices = None\*\*kwargs )

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [ResNetModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/resnet#transformers.ResNetModel). It is used to instantiate an ResNet model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the ResNet [microsoft/resnet-50](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/resnet-50) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import ResNetConfig, ResNetModel

>>> 
>>> configuration = ResNetConfig()

>>> 
>>> model = ResNetModel(configuration)

>>> 
>>> configuration = model.config
```

## ResNetModel

### class transformers.ResNetModel

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/resnet/modeling_resnet.py#L303)

( config )

Parameters

-   **config** ([ResNetConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/resnet#transformers.ResNetConfig)) ‚Äî Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The bare ResNet model outputting raw features without any specific head on top. This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

#### forward

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/resnet/modeling_resnet.py#L313)

( pixel\_values: Tensoroutput\_hidden\_states: typing.Optional\[bool\] = Nonereturn\_dict: typing.Optional\[bool\] = None ) ‚Üí `transformers.modeling_outputs.BaseModelOutputWithPoolingAndNoAttention` or `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`

The [ResNetModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/resnet#transformers.ResNetModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, ResNetModel
>>> import torch
>>> from datasets import load_dataset

>>> dataset = load_dataset("huggingface/cats-image")
>>> image = dataset["test"]["image"][0]

>>> image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/resnet-50")
>>> model = ResNetModel.from_pretrained("microsoft/resnet-50")

>>> inputs = image_processor(image, return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
>>> list(last_hidden_states.shape)
