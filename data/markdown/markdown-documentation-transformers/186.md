# Informer

## Overview

The Informer model was proposed in [Informer: Beyond Efficient Transformer for Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07436) by Haoyi Zhou, Shanghang Zhang, Jieqi Peng, Shuai Zhang, Jianxin Li, Hui Xiong, and Wancai Zhang.

This method introduces a Probabilistic Attention mechanism to select the ‚Äúactive‚Äù queries rather than the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù queries and provides a sparse Transformer thus mitigating the quadratic compute and memory requirements of vanilla attention.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

_Many real-world applications require the prediction of long sequence time-series, such as electricity consumption planning. Long sequence time-series forecasting (LSTF) demands a high prediction capacity of the model, which is the ability to capture precise long-range dependency coupling between output and input efficiently. Recent studies have shown the potential of Transformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several severe issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable to LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent limitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we design an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with three distinctive characteristics: (i) a ProbSparse self-attention mechanism, which achieves O(L logL) in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences‚Äô dependency alignment. (ii) the self-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading layer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem._

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of an [InformerModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/informer#transformers.InformerModel). It is used to instantiate an Informer model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Informer [huggingface/informer-tourism-monthly](https://huggingface.co/huggingface/informer-tourism-monthly) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) can be used to control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import InformerConfig, InformerModel

>>> 
>>> configuration = InformerConfig(prediction_length=12)

>>> 
>>> model = InformerModel(configuration)

>>> 
>>> configuration = model.config
```

Parameters

-   **past\_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`) ‚Äî Past values of the time series, that serve as context in order to predict the future. The sequence size of this tensor must be larger than the `context_length` of the model, since the model will use the larger size to construct lag features, i.e. additional values from the past which are added in order to serve as ‚Äúextra context‚Äù.
    
    The `sequence_length` here is equal to `config.context_length` + `max(config.lags_sequence)`, which if no `lags_sequence` is configured, is equal to `config.context_length` + 7 (as by default, the largest look-back index in `config.lags_sequence` is 7). The property `_past_length` returns the actual length of the past.
    
    The `past_values` is what the Transformer encoder gets as input (with optional additional features, such as `static_categorical_features`, `static_real_features`, `past_time_features` and lags).
    
    Optionally, missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `past_observed_mask`.
    
    For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of variates in the time series per time step.
    
-   **past\_time\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`) ‚Äî Required time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like ‚Äúmonth of year‚Äù, ‚Äúday of the month‚Äù, etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These could also be so-called ‚Äúage‚Äù features, which basically help the model know ‚Äúat which point in life‚Äù a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.
    
    These features serve as the ‚Äúpositional encodings‚Äù of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
    
    Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features must but known at prediction time.
    
    The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num\_time\_features`+`config.num\_dynamic\_real\_features\`.
    
-   **past\_observed\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for values that are **observed**,
    -   0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
    
-   **static\_categorical\_features** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the values of the time series.
    
    Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).
    
    A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
    
-   **static\_real\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.
    
    Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).
    
    A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
    
-   **future\_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)` or `(batch_size, prediction_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the Transformer needs during training to learn to output, given the `past_values`.
    
    The sequence length here is equal to `prediction_length`.
    
    See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.
    
    Optionally, during training any missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `future_observed_mask`.
    
    For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of variates in the time series per time step.
    
-   **future\_time\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`) ‚Äî Required time features for the prediction window, which the model internally will add to `future_values`. These could be things like ‚Äúmonth of year‚Äù, ‚Äúday of the month‚Äù, etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These could also be so-called ‚Äúage‚Äù features, which basically help the model know ‚Äúat which point in life‚Äù a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.
    
    These features serve as the ‚Äúpositional encodings‚Äù of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
    
    Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features must but known at prediction time.
    
    The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num\_time\_features`+`config.num\_dynamic\_real\_features\`.
    
-   **future\_observed\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Boolean mask to indicate which `future_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for values that are **observed**,
    -   0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
    
    This mask is used to filter out missing values for the final loss calculation.
    
-   **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

    -   0 for tokens that are **masked**.

-   **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices.

The [InformerModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/informer#transformers.InformerModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

## InformerForPrediction

### class transformers.InformerForPrediction

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/informer/modeling_informer.py#L1771)

( config: InformerConfig )

Parameters

-   **config** ([TimeSeriesTransformerConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/time_series_transformer#transformers.TimeSeriesTransformerConfig)) ‚Äî Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The Informer Model with a distribution head on top for time-series forecasting. This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Parameters

-   **past\_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`) ‚Äî Past values of the time series, that serve as context in order to predict the future. The sequence size of this tensor must be larger than the `context_length` of the model, since the model will use the larger size to construct lag features, i.e. additional values from the past which are added in order to serve as ‚Äúextra context‚Äù.
    
    The `sequence_length` here is equal to `config.context_length` + `max(config.lags_sequence)`, which if no `lags_sequence` is configured, is equal to `config.context_length` + 7 (as by default, the largest look-back index in `config.lags_sequence` is 7). The property `_past_length` returns the actual length of the past.
    
    The `past_values` is what the Transformer encoder gets as input (with optional additional features, such as `static_categorical_features`, `static_real_features`, `past_time_features` and lags).
    
    Optionally, missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `past_observed_mask`.
    
    For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of variates in the time series per time step.
    
-   **past\_time\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_features)`) ‚Äî Required time features, which the model internally will add to `past_values`. These could be things like ‚Äúmonth of year‚Äù, ‚Äúday of the month‚Äù, etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These could also be so-called ‚Äúage‚Äù features, which basically help the model know ‚Äúat which point in life‚Äù a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.
    
    These features serve as the ‚Äúpositional encodings‚Äù of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
    
    Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features must but known at prediction time.
    
    The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num\_time\_features`+`config.num\_dynamic\_real\_features\`.
    
-   **past\_observed\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Boolean mask to indicate which `past_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for values that are **observed**,
    -   0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
    
-   **static\_categorical\_features** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static categorical features)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Optional static categorical features for which the model will learn an embedding, which it will add to the values of the time series.
    
    Static categorical features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).
    
    A typical example of a static categorical feature is a time series ID.
    
-   **static\_real\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, number of static real features)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Optional static real features which the model will add to the values of the time series.
    
    Static real features are features which have the same value for all time steps (static over time).
    
    A typical example of a static real feature is promotion information.
    
-   **future\_values** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length)` or `(batch_size, prediction_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Future values of the time series, that serve as labels for the model. The `future_values` is what the Transformer needs during training to learn to output, given the `past_values`.
    
    The sequence length here is equal to `prediction_length`.
    
    See the demo notebook and code snippets for details.
    
    Optionally, during training any missing values need to be replaced with zeros and indicated via the `future_observed_mask`.
    
    For multivariate time series, the `input_size` > 1 dimension is required and corresponds to the number of variates in the time series per time step.
    
-   **future\_time\_features** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, prediction_length, num_features)`) ‚Äî Required time features for the prediction window, which the model internally will add to `future_values`. These could be things like ‚Äúmonth of year‚Äù, ‚Äúday of the month‚Äù, etc. encoded as vectors (for instance as Fourier features). These could also be so-called ‚Äúage‚Äù features, which basically help the model know ‚Äúat which point in life‚Äù a time-series is. Age features have small values for distant past time steps and increase monotonically the more we approach the current time step. Holiday features are also a good example of time features.
    
    These features serve as the ‚Äúpositional encodings‚Äù of the inputs. So contrary to a model like BERT, where the position encodings are learned from scratch internally as parameters of the model, the Time Series Transformer requires to provide additional time features. The Time Series Transformer only learns additional embeddings for `static_categorical_features`.
    
    Additional dynamic real covariates can be concatenated to this tensor, with the caveat that these features must but known at prediction time.
    
    The `num_features` here is equal to `config.`num\_time\_features`+`config.num\_dynamic\_real\_features\`.
    
-   **future\_observed\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)` or `(batch_size, sequence_length, input_size)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Boolean mask to indicate which `future_values` were observed and which were missing. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for values that are **observed**,
    -   0 for values that are **missing** (i.e. NaNs that were replaced by zeros).
    
    This mask is used to filter out missing values for the final loss calculation.
    
-   **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
    -   0 for tokens that are **masked**.
    
    [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
    
-   **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to avoid performing attention on certain token indices.

-   **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(encoder_layers, encoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:

    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **encoder\_outputs** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) ‚Äî Tuple consists of `last_hidden_state`, `hidden_states` (_optional_) and `attentions` (_optional_) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` (_optional_) is a sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder.

The [InformerForPrediction](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/informer#transformers.InformerForPrediction) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.
