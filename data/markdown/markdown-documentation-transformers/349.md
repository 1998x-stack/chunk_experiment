## Overview

FSMT (FairSeq MachineTranslation) models were introduced in [Facebook FAIR’s WMT19 News Translation Task Submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06616) by Nathan Ng, Kyra Yee, Alexei Baevski, Myle Ott, Michael Auli, Sergey Edunov.

The abstract of the paper is the following:

_This paper describes Facebook FAIR’s submission to the WMT19 shared news translation task. We participate in two language pairs and four language directions, English <-> German and English <-> Russian. Following our submission from last year, our baseline systems are large BPE-based transformer models trained with the Fairseq sequence modeling toolkit which rely on sampled back-translations. This year we experiment with different bitext data filtering schemes, as well as with adding filtered back-translated data. We also ensemble and fine-tune our models on domain-specific data, then decode using noisy channel model reranking. Our submissions are ranked first in all four directions of the human evaluation campaign. On En->De, our system significantly outperforms other systems as well as human translations. This system improves upon our WMT’18 submission by 4.5 BLEU points._

This model was contributed by [stas](https://huggingface.co/stas). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/wmt19).

## Implementation Notes

-   FSMT uses source and target vocabulary pairs that aren’t combined into one. It doesn’t share embeddings tokens either. Its tokenizer is very similar to [XLMTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/xlm#transformers.XLMTokenizer) and the main model is derived from [BartModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/bart#transformers.BartModel).

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [FSMTModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/fsmt#transformers.FSMTModel). It is used to instantiate a FSMT model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the FSMT [facebook/wmt19-en-ru](https://huggingface.co/facebook/wmt19-en-ru) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```
>>> from transformers import FSMTConfig, FSMTModel

>>> 
>>> config = FSMTConfig()

>>> 
>>> model = FSMTModel(config)

>>> 
>>> configuration = model.config
```

    Indices can be obtained using `FSTMTokenizer`. See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/vits#transformers.VitsTokenizer.__call__) for details.
    
    [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
    
-   **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for tokens that are **not masked**,

    [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
    
-   **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
    
    Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/vits#transformers.VitsTokenizer.__call__) for details.
    
    [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)
    
    FSMT uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).
    
-   **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also be used by default.
-   **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(encoder_layers, encoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,

Can be used to speed up decoding. If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that don’t have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
-   **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) — Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
-   **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) — Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
    
    If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value of `inputs_embeds`.

The [FSMTModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/fsmt#transformers.FSMTModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, FSMTModel
>>> import torch

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/wmt19-ru-en")
>>> model = FSMTModel.from_pretrained("facebook/wmt19-ru-en")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)

>>> last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

Parameters

-   **input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`) — Indices of input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
    
    Indices can be obtained using `FSTMTokenizer`. See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/vits#transformers.VitsTokenizer.__call__) for details.
    
    [What are input IDs?](../glossary#input-ids)
    
-   **attention\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Mask to avoid performing attention on padding token indices. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 for tokens that are **not masked**,
    -   0 for tokens that are **masked**.
    
    [What are attention masks?](../glossary#attention-mask)
    
-   **decoder\_input\_ids** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Indices of decoder input sequence tokens in the vocabulary.
    
    Indices can be obtained using [AutoTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer). See [PreTrainedTokenizer.encode()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizerFast.encode) and [PreTrainedTokenizer.**call**()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/vits#transformers.VitsTokenizer.__call__) for details.
    
    [What are decoder input IDs?](../glossary#decoder-input-ids)
    
    FSMT uses the `eos_token_id` as the starting token for `decoder_input_ids` generation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_input_ids` have to be input (see `past_key_values`).
    
-   **decoder\_attention\_mask** (`torch.BoolTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Default behavior: generate a tensor that ignores pad tokens in `decoder_input_ids`. Causal mask will also be used by default.
-   **head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(encoder_layers, encoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the encoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **decoder\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **cross\_attn\_head\_mask** (`torch.Tensor` of shape `(decoder_layers, decoder_attention_heads)`, _optional_) — Mask to nullify selected heads of the cross-attention modules in the decoder. Mask values selected in `[0, 1]`:
    
    -   1 indicates the head is **not masked**,
    -   0 indicates the head is **masked**.
    
-   **encoder\_outputs** (`Tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, _optional_) — Tuple consists of (`last_hidden_state`, _optional_: `hidden_states`, _optional_: `attentions`) `last_hidden_state` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)` is a sequence of hidden-states at the output of the last layer of the encoder. Used in the cross-attention of the decoder.
-   **past\_key\_values** (`Tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers` with each tuple having 4 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length - 1, embed_size_per_head)`) — Contains precomputed key and value hidden-states of the attention blocks. Can be used to speed up decoding. If `past_key_values` are used, the user can optionally input only the last `decoder_input_ids` (those that don’t have their past key value states given to this model) of shape `(batch_size, 1)` instead of all `decoder_input_ids` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`.
-   **inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) — Optionally, instead of passing `input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
-   **decoder\_inputs\_embeds** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, target_sequence_length, hidden_size)`, _optional_) — Optionally, instead of passing `decoder_input_ids` you can choose to directly pass an embedded representation. If `past_key_values` is used, optionally only the last `decoder_inputs_embeds` have to be input (see `past_key_values`). This is useful if you want more control over how to convert `decoder_input_ids` indices into associated vectors than the model’s internal embedding lookup matrix.
    
    If `decoder_input_ids` and `decoder_inputs_embeds` are both unset, `decoder_inputs_embeds` takes the value of `inputs_embeds`.
    
-   **use\_cache** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `True`) — If set to `True`, `past_key_values` key value states are returned and can be used to speed up decoding (see `past_key_values`).
-   **output\_attentions** (`bool`, _optional_) — Whether or not to return the attentions tensors of all attention layers. See `attentions` under returned tensors for more detail.
-   **output\_hidden\_states** (`bool`, _optional_) — Whether or not to return the hidden states of all layers. See `hidden_states` under returned tensors for more detail.
-   **return\_dict** (`bool`, _optional_) — Whether or not to return a [ModelOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.utils.ModelOutput) instead of a plain tuple.
-   **labels** (`torch.LongTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length)`, _optional_) — Labels for computing the masked language modeling loss. Indices should either be in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]` or -100 (see `input_ids` docstring). Tokens with indices set to `-100` are ignored (masked), the loss is only computed for the tokens with labels in `[0, ..., config.vocab_size]`.

A [transformers.modeling\_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/output#transformers.modeling_outputs.Seq2SeqLMOutput) or a tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (if `return_dict=False` is passed or when `config.return_dict=False`) comprising various elements depending on the configuration ([FSMTConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/fsmt#transformers.FSMTConfig)) and inputs.

-   **logits** (`torch.FloatTensor` of shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, config.vocab_size)`) — Prediction scores of the language modeling head (scores for each vocabulary token before SoftMax).
    
-   **past\_key\_values** (`tuple(tuple(torch.FloatTensor))`, _optional_, returned when `use_cache=True` is passed or when `config.use_cache=True`) — Tuple of `tuple(torch.FloatTensor)` of length `config.n_layers`, with each tuple having 2 tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`) and 2 additional tensors of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, encoder_sequence_length, embed_size_per_head)`.

The [FSMTForConditionalGeneration](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/fsmt#transformers.FSMTForConditionalGeneration) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.
