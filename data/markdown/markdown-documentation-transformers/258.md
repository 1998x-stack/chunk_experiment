[![Models](https://img.shields.io/badge/All_model_pages-roberta-blueviolet)](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=roberta) [![Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/docs-demos/roberta-base) [![Paper page](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paper%20page-1907.11692-green)](https://huggingface.co/papers/1907.11692)

## Overview

The RoBERTa model was proposed in [RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) by Yinhan Liu, [Myle Ott](https://huggingface.co/myleott), Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google’s BERT model released in 2018.

It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

_Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code._

Tips:

-   This implementation is the same as [BertModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/bert#transformers.BertModel) with a tiny embeddings tweak as well as a setup for Roberta pretrained models.
    
-   RoBERTa has the same architecture as BERT, but uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer (same as GPT-2) and uses a different pretraining scheme.
    
-   RoBERTa doesn’t have `token_type_ids`, you don’t need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or `</s>`)
    
-   Same as BERT with better pretraining tricks:
    
    -   dynamic masking: tokens are masked differently at each epoch, whereas BERT does it once and for all
    -   together to reach 512 tokens (so the sentences are in an order than may span several documents)
    -   train with larger batches
    -   use BPE with bytes as a subunit and not characters (because of unicode characters)
-   [CamemBERT](camembert) is a wrapper around RoBERTa. Refer to this page for usage examples.

## RobertaConfig

### class transformers.RobertaConfig

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/roberta/configuration_roberta.py#L37)

This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel) or a [TFRobertaModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.TFRobertaModel). It is used to instantiate a RoBERTa model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RoBERTa [roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) architecture.

Configuration objects inherit from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the documentation from [PretrainedConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/configuration#transformers.PretrainedConfig) for more information.

Examples:

```
>>> from transformers import RobertaConfig, RobertaModel

>>> 
>>> configuration = RobertaConfig()

>>> 
>>> model = RobertaModel(configuration)

>>> 
>>> configuration = model.config
```

## RobertaTokenizer

### class transformers.RobertaTokenizer

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/roberta/tokenization_roberta.py#L107)

( vocab\_filemerges\_fileerrors = 'replace'bos\_token = '<s>'eos\_token = '</s>'sep\_token = '</s>'cls\_token = '<s>'unk\_token = '<unk>'pad\_token = '<pad>'mask\_token = '<mask>'add\_prefix\_space = False\*\*kwargs )

Constructs a RoBERTa tokenizer, derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizer

>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

This tokenizer inherits from [PreTrainedTokenizer](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer) which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

( token\_ids\_0: typing.List\[int\]token\_ids\_1: typing.Optional\[typing.List\[int\]\] = None ) → `List[int]`

Parameters

-   **token\_ids\_0** (`List[int]`) — List of IDs to which the special tokens will be added.
-   **token\_ids\_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) — Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

List of [input IDs](../glossary#input-ids) with the appropriate special tokens.

Build model inputs from a sequence or a pair of sequence for sequence classification tasks by concatenating and adding special tokens. A RoBERTa sequence has the following format:

-   single sequence: `<s> X </s>`
-   pair of sequences: `<s> A </s></s> B </s>`

#### get\_special\_tokens\_mask

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/roberta/tokenization_roberta.py#L379)

( token\_ids\_0: typing.List\[int\]token\_ids\_1: typing.Optional\[typing.List\[int\]\] = Nonealready\_has\_special\_tokens: bool = False ) → `List[int]`

Parameters

-   **token\_ids\_0** (`List[int]`) — List of IDs.
-   **token\_ids\_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) — Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.
-   **already\_has\_special\_tokens** (`bool`, _optional_, defaults to `False`) — Whether or not the token list is already formatted with special tokens for the model.

A list of integers in the range \[0, 1\]: 1 for a special token, 0 for a sequence token.

Retrieve sequence ids from a token list that has no special tokens added. This method is called when adding special tokens using the tokenizer `prepare_for_model` method.

#### create\_token\_type\_ids\_from\_sequences

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/roberta/tokenization_roberta.py#L406)

( token\_ids\_0: typing.List\[int\]token\_ids\_1: typing.Optional\[typing.List\[int\]\] = None ) → `List[int]`

Parameters

-   **token\_ids\_0** (`List[int]`) — List of IDs.
-   **token\_ids\_1** (`List[int]`, _optional_) — Optional second list of IDs for sequence pairs.

List of zeros.

Create a mask from the two sequences passed to be used in a sequence-pair classification task. RoBERTa does not make use of token type ids, therefore a list of zeros is returned.

#### save\_vocabulary

Construct a “fast” RoBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace’s _tokenizers_ library), derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will

be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

```
>>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizerFast

>>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
>>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 31414, 232, 2]

>>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
[0, 20920, 232, 2]
```

( configadd\_pooling\_layer = True )

Parameters

-   **config** ([RobertaConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaConfig)) — Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The bare RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in _Attention is all you need_\_ by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

The [RobertaModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaModel) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, RobertaModel

>>> model = RobertaModel.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")

### class transformers.RobertaForSequenceClassification

[< source \>](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.34.0/src/transformers/models/roberta/modeling_roberta.py#L1157)

( config )

Parameters

-   **config** ([RobertaConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaConfig)) — Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

RoBERTa Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

The [RobertaForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaForSequenceClassification) forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example of single-label classification:

```
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, RobertaForSequenceClassification

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion")
>>> model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()
>>> model.config.id2label[predicted_class_id]
'optimism'

>>> 
>>> num_labels = len(model.config.id2label)
>>> model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion", num_labels=num_labels)

>>> labels = torch.tensor([1])
>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss
>>> round(loss.item(), 2)

```

Example of multi-label classification:

>>> 
>>> num_labels = len(model.config.id2label)
>>> model = RobertaForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(

( \*args\*\*kwargs )

Parameters

-   **config** ([RobertaConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/roberta#transformers.RobertaConfig)) — Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The bare RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

TensorFlow models and layers in `transformers` accept two formats as input:

-   having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
-   having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional argument.

The reason the second format is supported is that Keras methods prefer this format when passing inputs to models and layers. Because of this support, when using methods like `model.fit()` things should “just work” for you - just pass your inputs and labels in any format that `model.fit()` supports! If, however, you want to use the second format outside of Keras methods like `fit()` and `predict()`, such as when creating your own layers or models with the Keras `Functional` API, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the first positional argument:

-   a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(input_ids)`
-   a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring: `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
-   a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring: `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Note that when creating models and layers with [subclassing](https://keras.io/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/) then you don’t need to worry about any of this, as you can just pass inputs like you would to any other Python function!

RoBERTa Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel).

TensorFlow models and layers in `transformers` accept two formats as input:

-   having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
-   having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional argument.

The reason the second format is supported is that Keras methods prefer this format when passing inputs to models and layers. Because of this support, when using methods like `model.fit()` things should “just work” for you - just pass your inputs and labels in any format that `model.fit()` supports! If, however, you want to use the second format outside of Keras methods like `fit()` and `predict()`, such as when creating your own layers or models with the Keras `Functional` API, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the first positional argument:

-   a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(input_ids)`
-   a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring: `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
-   a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring: `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Note that when creating models and layers with [subclassing](https://keras.io/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/) then you don’t need to worry about any of this, as you can just pass inputs like you would to any other Python function!

The `FlaxRobertaPreTrainedModel` forward method, overrides the `__call__` special method.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example:

```
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, FlaxRobertaForMaskedLM

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("roberta-base")
>>> model = FlaxRobertaForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("roberta-base")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("The capital of France is [MASK].", return_tensors="jax")

>>> outputs = model(**inputs)
