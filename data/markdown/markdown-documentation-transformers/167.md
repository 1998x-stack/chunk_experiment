## Overview

The Funnel Transformer model was proposed in the paper [Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03236). It is a bidirectional transformer model, like BERT, but with a pooling operation after each block of layers, a bit like in traditional convolutional neural networks (CNN) in computer vision.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

_With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension._

Tips:

-   Since Funnel Transformer uses pooling, the sequence length of the hidden states changes after each block of layers. This way, their length is divided by 2, which speeds up the computation of the next hidden states. The base model therefore has a final sequence length that is a quarter of the original one. This model can be used directly for tasks that just require a sentence summary (like sequence classification or multiple choice). For other tasks, the full model is used; this full model has a decoder that upsamples the final hidden states to the same sequence length as the input.
-   For tasks such as classification, this is not a problem, but for tasks like masked language modeling or token classification, we need a hidden state with the same sequence length as the original input. In those cases, the final hidden states are upsampled to the input sequence length and go through two additional layers. That’s why there are two versions of each checkpoint. The version suffixed with “-base” contains only the three blocks, while the version without that suffix contains the three blocks and the upsampling head with its additional layers.
-   The Funnel Transformer checkpoints are all available with a full version and a base version. The first ones should be used for [FunnelModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelModel), [FunnelForPreTraining](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForPreTraining), [FunnelForMaskedLM](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForMaskedLM), [FunnelForTokenClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForTokenClassification) and [FunnelForQuestionAnswering](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForQuestionAnswering). The second ones should be used for [FunnelBaseModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelBaseModel), [FunnelForSequenceClassification](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForSequenceClassification) and [FunnelForMultipleChoice](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelForMultipleChoice).

Parameters

-   **config** ([FunnelConfig](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/model_doc/funnel#transformers.FunnelConfig)) — Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

The base Funnel Transformer Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without upsampling head (also called decoder) or any task-specific head on top.

The Funnel Transformer model was proposed in [Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03236) by Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le.

This model inherits from [PreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

Example of single-label classification:

```
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, FunnelForSequenceClassification

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("funnel-transformer/small-base")
>>> model = FunnelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("funnel-transformer/small-base")

>>> inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     logits = model(**inputs).logits

>>> predicted_class_id = logits.argmax().item()

>>> 
>>> num_labels = len(model.config.id2label)
>>> model = FunnelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("funnel-transformer/small-base", num_labels=num_labels)

>>> labels = torch.tensor([1])
>>> loss = model(**inputs, labels=labels).loss
```

Example of multi-label classification:

```
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, FunnelForSequenceClassification

>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("funnel-transformer/small-base")
>>> model = FunnelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("funnel-transformer/small-base", problem_type="multi_label_classification")

The base Funnel Transformer Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without upsampling head (also called decoder) or any task-specific head on top.

The Funnel Transformer model was proposed in [Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03236) by Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le.

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

TensorFlow models and layers in `transformers` accept two formats as input:

-   having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
-   having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional argument.

The reason the second format is supported is that Keras methods prefer this format when passing inputs to models and layers. Because of this support, when using methods like `model.fit()` things should “just work” for you - just pass your inputs and labels in any format that `model.fit()` supports! If, however, you want to use the second format outside of Keras methods like `fit()` and `predict()`, such as when creating your own layers or models with the Keras `Functional` API, there are three possibilities you can use to gather all the input Tensors in the first positional argument:

-   a single Tensor with `input_ids` only and nothing else: `model(input_ids)`
-   a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring: `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
-   a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring: `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Note that when creating models and layers with [subclassing](https://keras.io/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/) then you don’t need to worry about any of this, as you can just pass inputs like you would to any other Python function!

-   a list of varying length with one or several input Tensors IN THE ORDER given in the docstring: `model([input_ids, attention_mask])` or `model([input_ids, attention_mask, token_type_ids])`
-   a dictionary with one or several input Tensors associated to the input names given in the docstring: `model({"input_ids": input_ids, "token_type_ids": token_type_ids})`

Note that when creating models and layers with [subclassing](https://keras.io/guides/making_new_layers_and_models_via_subclassing/) then you don’t need to worry about any of this, as you can just pass inputs like you would to any other Python function!

Although the recipe for forward pass needs to be defined within this function, one should call the `Module` instance afterwards instead of this since the former takes care of running the pre and post processing steps while the latter silently ignores them.

( \*args\*\*kwargs )

Parameters

-   **config** (`XxxConfig`) — Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the [from\_pretrained()](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained) method to load the model weights.

Funnel Model transformer with a sequence classification/regression head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output) e.g. for GLUE tasks.

The Funnel Transformer model was proposed in [Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03236) by Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le.

This model inherits from [TFPreTrainedModel](/docs/transformers/v4.34.0/en/main_classes/model#transformers.TFPreTrainedModel). Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads etc.)

This model is also a [tf.keras.Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) subclass. Use it as a regular TF 2.0 Keras Model and refer to the TF 2.0 documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

TensorFlow models and layers in `transformers` accept two formats as input:

-   having all inputs as keyword arguments (like PyTorch models), or
-   having all inputs as a list, tuple or dict in the first positional argument.

The reason the second format is supported is that Keras methods prefer this format when passing inputs to models and layers. Because of this support, when using methods like `model.fit()` things should “just work” for you - just pass your inputs and labels in any format that `model.fit()` supports!
