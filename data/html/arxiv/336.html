<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Gaussian process fitting, or kriging, is often used to create a model from a set of data. Many available software packages do this, but we show that very different results can be obtained from different packages even when using the same data and model.
We describe the parameterization, features, and optimization used by eight different fitting packages that run on four different platforms.
We then compare these eight packages using various data functions and data sets, revealing that there are stark differences between the packages.
In addition to comparing the prediction accuracy, the predictive variance—which is important for evaluating precision of predictions and is often used in stopping criteria—is also evaluated.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">When computer simulation models are used to study complex systems, it is often useful to fit an empirical mathematical model to quickly approximate the time-consuming computer simulation at input values that have not yet been evaluated. If fit to sufficient accuracy, these metamodels can replace the original computer models in optimization or “what if” analyses. Gaussian process (GP) modeling is commonly used for fitting metamodels in simulation experiments since it provides a flexible model and model-based estimate of prediction error even if the simulation itself is deterministic.
Gaussian process models can also be used when the simulation is stochastic, although this requires an extension of the model.
Gaussian process models have become a large part in the expanding machine learning toolbox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rasmussen and Williams, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper we are concerned with how GP models are used by practitioners, so we compare the performance of some commonly used software packages. Many practitioners are not familiar with the particulars of GP fitting, so we investigate packages that are relatively easy to use and do not require extensive knowledge of all the options and parameters that can be specified.
GP fitting is unlike linear regression where, for a given data set, all software packages will produce exactly the same parameter estimates and fitted surface (up to round-off error). Most GP fitting packages use essentially the same equations, but there is variability in how parameters are defined and estimated through numerical optimization. So, in practice, different packages can give substantially different results. Since GP fitting is often used over other fitting techniques because of its model-based estimate of prediction error, the quality of a software implementation depends not only on the accuracy of the fitted surface, but also the accuracy of the error predictions. In many applications, random noise or computational limitations do not allow for extrinsic measures of prediction accuracy, and thus an easily obtained estimate of the uncertainty of prediction is valuable if it is at least reasonably accurate.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S1.SS1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Our major interest in GP fitting is its use to sequentially build an accurate metamodel of a computer simulation over a broad range of input values.
This global metamodel could be built automatically using excess computing capacity and then when the need for real-time decision making arises, the quickly-evaluated metamodel can be used in place of the time-consuming computer simulation model.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.SS1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Sequential algorithms require a stopping criterion.
For building an accurate global metamodel, a stopping criterion that is a function of the estimated prediction error makes sense.
Many fitting methods, such as splines and neural networks, provide no estimate of prediction error apart from extrinsic methods like cross validation which are not related to the fitted model itself. This is where the model-based estimate of GP fitting is very attractive. In addition to its use as a stopping criterion, prediction error estimates can be used by a sequential algorithm to determine the location of the next set of design points to run with the actual computer simulation model. We think of the sequential selection of these design points as a sequential experiment design. A sequential experiment design is called non-adaptive if the location of each additional design point is related only to the location of the previous design points in the input space. An adaptive sequential experiment design uses not only the location of the previous design points, but also the observed value of the response at those design points.
If the objective is to find the location of an optimum,
adaptive designs are vastly more efficient because they can select locations where the response is likely to be desirable.
However, for building an accurate global metamodel, the response information can be used to select design points where the prediction error is estimated to be large or locations that would help estimate the metamodel parameters more accurately. Our goal is to determine which software packages have the capability of effectively and reliably estimating locations for new design points by estimating the metamodel and its prediction error.</p>

<div id="S1.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">GP metamodels are well suited for fitting an accurate global metamodel since they can fit complicated surfaces, however they are computationally slow for large data sets.
On the other hand, if the goal is to find a optimum, then a GP can also be used as a surrogate model to search for extrema <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g., Jones et al., <a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite>.</p>

<p id="S1.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This study is inspired by our previous research where we found discrepancies between two software packages that were using the same GP model but were giving different results, particularly in the estimation of the prediction error. We believe that others may also encounter similar issues with GP fitting and would benefit from an in-depth study of the various software options. Knowledgeable users may know how to improve the results by setting advanced options or tuning parameters. However, we are trying to find what works best for practitioners who may not have this specific knowledge. Thus, we select packages that are easy to use, and we have left as many options to the default setting as possible. For our comparisons we use packages from a mixture of platforms: the R <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(R Core Team, <a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite> packages DiceKriging, GPfit, laGP, and mlegp;
JMP, produced by SAS;
the MATLAB toolbox DACE;

It displays a sample of size six (black points) in one dimension fit using common options for three different software packages, which then give predictions of the output for <math id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">x</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1.1">𝑥</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS3.p2.1.m1.1c">x</annotation></semantics></math> between 0 and 1.
The details of the packages will be explained later in this paper.
The predictions given by laGPE smoothly interpolate between the observations.
We can see that mlegpE exhibits mean reversion, where it predicts the observed points correctly, but then quickly reverts to the mean away from those points.
At the other extreme, Dice2 oversmooths, causing its predictions to be far from the observed points.
Furthermore, the predictions of the standard error across the range of <math id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="x" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">x</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1.1">𝑥</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.SS3.p2.2.m2.1c">x</annotation></semantics></math> values will also be significantly different.

The correlation matrix is constructed such that the correlation of the outputs from any two distinct points in the input domain is inversely related to the distance between those two points.
In particular, the correlation goes to one as the distance between the two input points goes to zero, and the correlation goes to zero as the distance goes to infinity. This allows the output points to form a surface, but also places few constraints on the shapes and features of that surface.

Given the same parameters and the same data, different software should give the same predictions since they are using the same equations. Thus, the differences that we have observed in predicted values between software packages are likely caused by different parameter estimates.
Each software package uses some type of numerical optimization method to seek estimators for these parameters that maximize the likelihood function, see Section <a href="#S3.SS3" title="3.3 Optimization techniques ‣ 3 Gaussian process fitting in various software packages ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.3</span></a>.
Practitioners typically trust these optimization methods to work without intervention. Later in this paper, empirical studies essentially demonstrate the performance of the optimization methods for various software packages.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">The nugget allows for measurement error or stochasticity of the response. If the nugget is not used (i.e., set to zero), then the model will interpolate exactly, so the prediction error at a design point will be zero. This is often useful for deterministic computer experiments, but if the data is stochastic then a nugget should be estimated and used.
Using a nugget improves the numerical stability by making the correlation matrices easier to invert; this inversion can be a problem when there is a large number of sample points.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ranjan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite> provide a method to use the smallest nugget value that makes the computations stable, which can help balance the benefits of having stability and a small nugget. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gramacy and Lee (<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite> argue that the nugget provides protection when the assumption of stationarity is violated or the data is sparse, and they claim this protection is more important than stability.</p>

<p id="S3.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">DiceKriging</span> is an R package for kriging created by the DICE Consortium, which has also released the R packages DiceOptim, DiceDesign, and DiceEval <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Roustant et al., <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>. DiceOptim does the optimization performed when fitting DiceKriging models.
DiceKriging provides many options for fitting and is very thorough, so it may be a good choice for many R users.</p>

<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GPfit</span>, another R package, was created by MacDonald, Ranjan, and Chipman.
GPfit does the most extensive search in optimizing the maximum likelihood parameters, as detailed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">MacDonald et al. (<a href="#bib.bib37" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Even when the control parameters for the optimization were set to reduced values, GPfit was still slower than the other packages by orders of magnitude. With more than a hundred design points GPfit becomes prohibitively slow, while the other packages still run quickly. One advantage of GPfit is that it focuses on computational stability, using the ideas put forth in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ranjan et al. (<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. It sets the nugget to be the smallest value that will avoid singularity, meaning that the nugget is never estimated. Thus GPfit is best suited for noiseless data.
Since the default exponential power is 1.95 (instead of 2; see Equation <a href="#S2.E2" title="In 2.1 Model ‣ 2 GP fitting ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>), we include it as a separate model in some of the testing below.
However, we change the power to 2 for most of the testing to be comparable with the other packages.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">laGP</span> is an R package created by Robert Gramacy that provides an entirely new method for fitting using GPs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gramacy, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. The “la” stands for “local approximate” since the model is designed for large data sets. In the laGP model, sparsity is exploited so the kriging is done on a small number of design points that are most important for prediction at a given point <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gramacy and Apley, <a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>. Thus, it can be run when there are a million design points, since it uses only a small number of points to make predictions and leverages parallelism. For the purpose of this research, we only use the basic GP fitting functions provided by the package. Although it is an R package, the heart of it is a C implementation wrapped in R, meaning it should be faster than a basic R implementation. In its current state it is a rather minimal package with a focus on speed, so it has fewer additional options and may require more fine-tuning—but is extremely fast.</p>

It provides full GP modeling capabilities. A distinctive feature of mlegp is that the user can specify the nugget matrix up to a multiplicative constant, which can be useful when the response is heteroscedastic as in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Dancik and Dorman (<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.
Another feature is the ability to perform sensitivity analysis, letting the user quantify how the response is affected by parameters and how much variability in the output can be attributed to changes in the design matrix.</p>

GPy has a tremendous amount of functionality available for many different cases. During our preliminary tests, GPy gave poor results due to computation problems when it was version 0.6.

<p id="S3.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Another open source library for Python is scikit-learn, which we call <span id="S3.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">sklearn</span> since that is the name of the Python module <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Pedregosa et al., <a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>. It is targeted for machine learning, not just kriging, so there are many other modeling options available in the module.
Up through version 0.17, the kriging implementation was based on DACE. However, the Gaussian process functionality was vastly upgraded with version 0.18, released in September 2016 <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(scikit-learn
developers, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016a</a>)</cite>.
The update added options for the correlation function, called the kernel, including the Gaussian, Matérn, rational quadratic kernel, and others, as well as sum or product combinations of kernels.</p>

<p id="S3.p10.1" class="ltx_p">Since they all use nearly the same equations, the real challenge in model fitting is estimating the parameters. Whereas the predictions are calculated using formulas, parameters must be estimated by solving an optimization problem. Generally, the parameters are chosen to be those that maximize the likelihood. However, the solution found to this depends on starting values, bounds, the algorithm used, and the parameterization.
There is additional ambiguity since real data is typically not truly samples from an actual Gaussian process. The Gaussian process model is just a useful approximation technique, and thus there are no true parameter values.
The rest of this section examines the differences between
the package parameterizations,
the options available,
and the estimation methods.</p>

For both DiceKriging with the Gaussian (Dice2) and the Matérn (DiceM52), we let it estimate the nugget. Preliminary tests involving noiseless data did not reveal noticeable differences between fits based on no nuggest and an estimated nugget. We chose to include the version that estimates the nugget since DiceKriging is also useful for stochastic kriging.

The optimization is run through the Python module
“<span id="S3.SS3.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">paramz</span>.”
We use the default of L-BFGS-B.
We also use five optimization restarts to ensure the optimization results are favorable, although this increases the run time.</p>

There is an option to use multiple restarts to help the optimization avoid getting stuck in a local minima.
By default the number of restarts is zero,
which is what we use in our tests.
However, trying more restarts may improve performance. In our initial testing with sklearn, we observed poor results when the data was not scaled.
In our comparison tests in this paper, we scaled all our data to have mean 0 and range 1, as discussed in Section <span id="S3.SS3.p9.1.3" class="ltx_text"><a href="#S5" title="5 Empirical study results ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a></span>.</p>

<p id="S4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section, we discuss the criterion on which we will compare different GP fitting software packages.
When constructing a global metamodel, two properties of GP modeling are of primary importance:
(1) the accuracy of prediction, and (2) the accuracy of the estimate of prediction error. The first is important for obvious reasons. The second is important to allow the practitioner to assess whether the metamodel is fit for use or whether additional data is needed to improve its fit
The differences between parameterizations mentioned in Section <a href="#S3.SS1" title="3.1 Correlation functions and parameterizations ‣ 3 Gaussian process fitting in various software packages ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3.1</span></a> do not matter here because our interest is on the accuracy of the predictions.
We focus on global fitting, not on optimization where the comparison criterion would be the accuracy of the estimation of the optimal input vector and the estimated output scalar.</p>

<p id="S4.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">We use EMRMSE to assess the quality of the fit for a model. This measure is primarily useful when comparing two models fitting the same surface since the model with the lower EMRMSE fits the surface better.
Also, in our empirical studies in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Empirical study results ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the value of EMRMSE can be very roughly thought of as an average relative error for the model.
This is because EMRMSE estimates the standard deviation of the prediction errors, and, as discussed in Section <a href="#S5" title="5 Empirical study results ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, we scale the responses (at prediction and design points) to have a range of 1.</p>

For the entire set of prediction points, these will be correlated. Intuitively this makes sense because the prediction functions are continuous and the true surface is usually also continuous, so points near each other will necessarily have related errors. This error analysis requires the predictive covariance matrix so that the standardized errors can be decorrelated. This method places equal importance on all parts of the surface. However, in practice, one usually focuses on areas where the predicted error is large. Moreover, most software packages do not provide the predictive covariance matrix, and the errors can differ by orders of magnitude depending on how close they are to sample points.
For these reasons, we use EMRMSE and PMRMSE as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the estimated prediction error for a given model.</p>

<p id="S4.SS3.p1.3" class="ltx_p">Fitting GPs can be computationally intensive when the number of points is large. Thus we only want to make the computational investment when we will see a significant improvement over simpler models. In preliminary investigations, we found that when the surface is too trivial or the sample size is too small that fitting a linear model—or even just the mean—can give predictions similar to the fitted GP model.
Thus, in our empirical study, whenever we fit a GP model in <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">d</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝑑</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">d</annotation></semantics></math> dimensions, we also fit a <math id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="d" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">d</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1">𝑑</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">d</annotation></semantics></math>-dimensional hyperplane, which we call the linear model (LM).
Using the same prediction points, we then calculate the EMRMSE for the LM.
Use of the complicated GP model is only beneficial if the EMRMSE of the GP model is substantially less than that of the LM.
When the EMRMSE of the GP model is greater than or equal to that of the LM, it indicates that the GP model is unsuitable for the situation.
In either case, comparisons of GP model fitting are not of interest.

Users should be aware of the possibility of systematic underestimation of model error as seen in the borehole example.
These discrepancies between predicted errors and actual errors are likely due to the data not actually coming from a Gaussian process, so the surface does not match the model assumptions.
Methods such as cross-validation can be used to check for this problem.</p>

All macroreplicates for all packages were run on the same node of a Linux cluster, except for JMP which was run on a personal Dell laptop running Windows.
The relative run times for each package are the same for both sample sizes, and the same pattern is found on other test functions as well.
GPfit is by far the slowest, taking over 15 minutes per macroreplicate for <math id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="n=160" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1a"><mrow id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.cmml"><mi id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.2" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml">n</mi><mo id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.1" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.3" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml">160</mn></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1b"><apply id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1"><eq id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.1"></eq><ci id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.2">𝑛</ci><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1.1.3">160</cn></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS1.p7.4.m4.1c">n=160</annotation></semantics></math>.
JMP is the next slowest, taking two minutes per macroreplicate, but this data is unreliable since it was run on a different computer.
The next slowest is mlegp, taking about eight minutes, with GPy only slightly faster. The fastest packages were DiceKriging, laGP, sklearn, and DACE, which only took a handful of seconds. Thus we see that there is a massive difference in the run times, with a factor of over 1000 between the fastest and the slowest packages performing the same task.
The times shown in this plot are for the borehole function, but the relative times are similar for the other functions. In particular, GPfit and JMP are extremely slow, mlegp is also very slow, and the rest are much faster.
Therefore when one is choosing a package, it may be necessary to consider not only the model options and capability, but also how quickly it runs.
Run times must also be considered in the context of the data being used. If the data comes from a simulation model that takes hours per observation, then the difference of a minute may be negligible.</p>

JMP0 is consistently bad on these examples, while JMPE is very inconsistent, with a mixture of good and bad fits.
laGP6 is generally very good, while laGPE, despite being consistent, is one of the worst performers.
GPfit, mlegp, GPy, and sklearn perform the best on this function.
The error predictions for all packages except JMP are generally good, being within 25% of the actual error.
We can also see that the performance ordering of the packages on this problem is similar to those for the OTL circuit example in Figure <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 The OTL Circuit Function ‣ 5 Empirical study results ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>.

This demonstrates that in higher dimensions it is more difficult to get a fit that is substantially better than the linear model, especially when the function is relatively linear.
GPfit, laGP6, JMPE, GPy, and sklearn perform the best, but they all underestimate the error by a significant amount.</p>

<p id="S6.SS1.p1.4" class="ltx_p">While computer experiments often assume that there is no variability in the data, this is not the case in stochastic simulations.
When the noise is similar across the entire response surface, then the basic model should suffice by using the nugget term.
However, when the noise level varies across the surface, called heteroscedasticity, stochastic kriging should be used.
Stochastic kriging, by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ankenman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>, accommodates for noise in data collected by assuming that the variance in the data is different at each design point.
In order to estimate the noise at each point, replicates must be collected at every point in the design.
This is equivalent to having a different nugget at each design point.

Stochastic kriging models are often run in two stages.
In the first stage, a small number of samples are taken for all design points.
For the second stage, the number of samples for each point is allocated according to Equation (29) in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Ankenman et al.

<div id="S6.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Many advances in Gaussian process fitting have been adapting the method to be suitable for large amounts of data, such as by exploiting sparsity.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Snelson and Ghahramani (<a href="#bib.bib53" title="" class="ltx_ref">2005</a>)</cite> present a sparse GP method that reduces the size of the covariance matrix by using pseudo-input points.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hensman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> produce a method that works for data sets with millions of data points, which would be prohibitively slow for the standard model.
Sparsity can be induced into the correlation matrix by having a correlation function with compact support, meaning that it is zero for points that are sufficiently far away <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Rasmussen and Williams, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>, p. 87-8)</cite>. These functions usually are piecewise polynomials that resemble the Gaussian correlation function.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gramacy and Apley (<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> provides a way to fit GPs to large experiments quickly. Their model induces sparsity by only selecting the points that provide the greatest reduction in predictive variance when calculating the metamodel function at a given point. They also allow for quick sequential updating and trivial parallelization, making their method very practical. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gramacy (<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite> has provided the R package laGP that implements most of these methods, in addition to the basic model that we explore in this paper.
Further work in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Sung et al. (<a href="#bib.bib54" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> makes the search for the best sub-design much faster.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The recent paper by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Binois et al. (<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2016</a>)</cite> provides a significant improvement to stochastic kriging.
They provide a more favorable framework by putting the problem in an inferential scheme with a single objective and explicit derivatives.
They introduce some smoothing techniques that allow
design points without replicates to be used in the model, which is a shortcoming of previous versions of stochastic kriging.
Also, they use the Woodbury identity <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Woodbury, <a href="#bib.bib60" title="" class="ltx_ref">1950</a>)</cite> to ensure that the computational complexity is similar to other stochastic kriging methods.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Advances have also come by combining the Gaussian process with other models. Neural networks inspired the work of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Damianou and Lawrence (<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>, who present a deep Gaussian process model that uses hierarchical Gaussian process mappings. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Gramacy and Lee (<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite> add GPs to the Bayesian partition tree model of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chipman et al. (<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite> so that a GP is fit to each partition.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Williams and Barber (<a href="#bib.bib59" title="" class="ltx_ref">1998</a>)</cite> create a model that uses GPs for Bayesian classification.
There have also been advances by allowing the model to take categorical input.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Platt et al. (<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">2001</a>)</cite> use GPs with categorical input to generate music playlists.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Chen et al. (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite> address the use of stochastic kriging with categorical input.</p>

<div id="S6.SS2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">Some of the packages we investigate have advanced models available for users. GPy has many models, including classification, sparse regression, latent variable models, and more.
In addition to providing GP classification models, scikit-learn also has other machine learning models such as clustering, neural networks, and support vector machines.
laGP provides the approximate GP model, as explained above, that is useful for massive data sets.
When choosing a software package, users should consider the depth of options available on the platform, and what types of models they would potentially use beyond the basic GP model to get better results.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this paper, we study various Gaussian process fitting software packages, see Table <a href="#S3.T1" title="Table 1 ‣ 3 Gaussian process fitting in various software packages ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>, and compare their performance using the GP model with Gaussian correlation for global fitting.
We do not compare their performance for optimization, i.e., accurately locating an optimal point.
We assess them based on the quality of their response predictions and their error estimates, each of which are averaged across the region of interest.
Other possible criteria that we do not consider include maximum error and relative error.
In many cases the different packages give similar, or even indistinguishable, results—which is expected since they are using the same models on the same surfaces.
However, due to differences in the parameter estimation routines, the packages often give different results on complicated surfaces.</p>

DiceKriging also provides functionality for stochastic kriging, as demonstrated in Section <a href="#S6.SS1" title="6.1 Stochastic Kriging ‣ 6 Recent literature / Advanced models ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.1</span></a>.</p>

<div id="S7.SS1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Another R package, <span id="S7.SS1.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GPfit</span>, uses the most extensive parameter optimization, which makes it very dependable. In our tests we found GPfit to be reliable and give good results. The cost of this is that it takes significantly longer to use on larger data sets, taking noticeably longer on samples larger than even 50.
On the borehole test, each macroreplicate for GPfit for a sample size of 500 took over two hours, while all the other packages finished in minutes or even seconds.
For this reason we do not recommend using GPfit when the data set is large and time is valuable.
We ran GPfit with its default exponent of 1.95 in the correlation function and also used the Gaussian process model where that exponent is 2.00. In general we did not see a large difference between the two in performance or run time. GPfit uses 1.95 as the default because it is supposed to provide computational stability.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The R package <span id="S7.SS1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">laGP</span> is the fastest package we tested. We used it with estimating a nugget and with setting a small nugget, the latter of which gave better results.
The main benefit of laGP is that it runs very quickly, especially when repeatedly adding data in a sequential manner.
In addition, it provides some additional complex models that are useful for large data sets. Thus we do not recommend laGP for kriging with small sample sizes, but we do suggest looking into its advanced functionality if there are thousands of sample points.</p>

<span id="S7.SS1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mlegp</span>, performed well in our testing.
We used it with both setting the nugget to zero and estimating the nugget, and did not see a large difference.
In addition, mlegp was a little slower than the other packages, though not as slow as GPfit.
One benefit of mlegp is that it also can do stochastic kriging, as shown in Section <a href="#S6.SS1" title="6.1 Stochastic Kriging ‣ 6 Recent literature / Advanced models ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.1</span></a>.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">JMP</span> is a commercial software platform that makes data analysis easy for practitioners.
When the nugget was set to zero, JMP performed poorly on most of our test functions.
When the nugget was estimated, however, JMP performed substantially better, often on par with the best packages.
JMP seems to run relatively slow.
For our testing, JMP was run on a laptop and the other packages were run on a cluster. However in our experience, the other packages (except for GPfit) ran faster when also run on the same laptop.
Thus users should be careful when using JMP, particularly when the nugget is not estimated, since the results may be spurious, and users might get better and faster results using a different software option.</p>

DACE is very basic and has not been updated in years, so we recommend using other packages if there is a desire to progress to more advanced models.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S7.SS1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">GPy</span>, a Python module, gave the best fitting results in most of our tests.
It was an order of magnitude slower than the fastest package, and was generally in the middle in terms of speed. GPy also provides many options and advanced models that the practitioner can explore once they have mastered the basic model.</p>

<p id="S7.SS1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">Finally, the Python module <span id="S7.SS1.p9.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">scikit-learn</span> contains GP fitting capability in addition to many other machine learning algorithms.
It was near the best on most examples, but occasionally exhibited inconsistency.
In preliminary tests, we found that it performed better when the data is scaled and more optimization restarts are used.
It was also one of the fastest packages.
Although we only included the results using scikit-learn with the Gaussian correlation function in this paper,
we have found in some of our tests that using the Matérn correlation function gives better results.
Although scikit-learn does not provide advanced GP models, it does provide other machine learning models such as support vector machines and random forests. Thus it would be a useful tool for those who want to use a single platform for multiple machine learning methods.</p>

</h3>

<div id="S7.SS2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">This paper focuses on the traditional Gaussian process model with Gaussian correlation.
Despite specifying the same type of GP metamodel, we found that there are often significant differences between the metamodel predictions made by various software packages on the same data.
Practitioners should be aware of the quality of predictions, typical run time, and model options when choosing a modeling software to use.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.SS2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p">There are many modifications of the model and other correlation functions that will often give better and faster results if there is prior knowledge about the structure of the data or if there is a large number of observations. We focus on the simple model because it is used by many practitioners who do not want to spend the time to learn the intricacies of the model, but wish to use the power of GP fitting. However, if unstable or nonsensical results are observed when fitting the simple GP model, we encourage modelers to consider using the packages with more advanced features that we allude to in Section <a href="#S7.SS1" title="7.1 Summary of packages ‣ 7 Discussion ‣ Comparison of Gaussian process modeling software" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7.1</span></a>.</p>
