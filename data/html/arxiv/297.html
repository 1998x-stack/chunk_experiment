<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum phenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity.
In such a state, superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with unique distributions.
<span id="id1.id1.1" class="ltx_text">This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to special vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation, reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc.
By formulating a numerical model with theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex visualization.
By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane strategy to avoid ambiguity.<span id="id1.id1.1.1" class="ltx_text">
Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed.
These visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.</span></span></p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Superfluidity is a special state of matter <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> first discovered in liquid helium (Helium-II) in 1930s <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Since then, various superfluid phenomena have been found in different areas of physics, from condensed matter physics, high energy physics, to astrophysics.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Superfluids have many surprising properties, some of which are counterintuitive.
For example, superfluids have zero viscosity, so they can move frictionlessly; superfluids can exhibit extremely high thermal conductivity, so heat can be conducted in almost no time.
In one particular situation, liquid helium in superfluidity can flow out of the containing cup by itself and move along the wall without any external force <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
These interesting properties and behaviors result from macroscopic quantum phenomena, which cause strong correlation among the superfluid particles.
Therefore, superfluids behave very differently than classical fluids <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Studying superfluids has several potential applications.
For example, superfluid liquid helium has been used as a moderator to cool down neutrons.
The Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>BEC is a state of matter of a dilute gas of bosons cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero.</span></span></span>) with weak interactions, which also sustain superfluidity, provide platforms for many studies on quantum materials and quantum information.
Furthermore, superfluids with vortices and turbulence occur in almost all superfluid states, similar to classical vortices and turbulence in classical fluids, which are very important in many superfluid studies, with several particular properties.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Superfluid modeling.</span>  Early research on superfluids relied on real experiments <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.
Physicists had to design complicated methods to create a specific physical environment for a matter to reach the state of superfluidity, so that they can measure the physical properties of superfluids, e.g., thermal conductivity, dynamic viscosity, etc.
However, it is highly challenging to obtain high-precision experimental measurements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
Hence, it is very difficult to find out how superfluids behave subject to varying physical parameters and system configurations purely by real experiments.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">This motivates physicists to develop mathematical models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> to describe the dynamic behavior of superfluids.
However, unlike classical fluids, which are governed by the well-known Navier-Stokes equations, there is no well-established superfluid model that has been thoroughly verified and is general in handling a large variety of situations.
So far, only a few simple models <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>, <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> have been experimentally affirmed, and they do not involve superfluid vortices.
Research on superfluid modeling is still in active development.
The research in this paper is a collaborative work with theoretical physicists who study superfluid modeling, <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">in which</span> we aim to develop simulation and visualization methods to help them explore potential properties of superfluid models, as well as verify and compare their models with real observations.</p>

<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p6.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Superfluid vortices.</span>
One distinctive characteristic of superfluids is the formation of quantum vortices <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>, <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, which, in contrast to vortices in classical fluids, exhibit a quantized flux circulation of some quantity, e.g., phase.
This leads to some special phenomena not observed in classical fluids.
For example, a steady regularly-distributed vortex lattice can be experimentally observed in rotating superfluids, where the vortices are completely isolated from one to another.
Superfluid vortices are basic elements in quantum turbulence.
In addition to experimental observations in condensed matter physics, they are also applied to nuclear physics, high-energy physics, and cosmology, e.g., cosmic strings and vortex tangles in early Universe simulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Vortices are important features in fluids with extensive amount of work devoted to study them <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> and to perform visual analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> on them in classical fluids.
Since superfluid vortices differ from their classical counterparts, mainly due to the phase singularity of the model equation, we cannot directly apply existing flow visualization methods to superfluid vortices.
Moreover, studying superfluid vortices is an emerging research topic in physics, and much more is to be understood about their physical properties.
Hence, we work closely with physicists to design simulation and visualization methods to explore superfluid vortices based on their expertise.</p>

<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S1.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Overview of this work.</span>  In this work, our goal is to <span id="S1.p8.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">develop visualization methods to aid physicists to visualize and explore superfluid vortices, with an emphasis on applications to support intuitive scientific study</span>.
To visualize superfluid vortices, <span id="S1.p8.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">data sets need to be first prepared typically</span> by means of simulations based on the governing model equations. Here in particular, we employ and solve the model equation derived in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>, which is a very recent superfluid model, theoretically proven to be a more accurate one that can cover the entire velocity range, from zero to the speed of light.
Note that while <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> focuses on the model derivation, this work develops methods for high-quality superfluid vortex visualization, where we numerically solve the model equation with efficiency (which has not been done in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>), enhance the quality of the resulting superfluid data sets, effectively identify and extract superfluid vortices, and then visualize different superfluid phenomenon, as well as perform associated visual study with domain experts in superfluid research.
In summary, this work has the following key technical contributions:</p>
<ul id="S1.I1" class="ltx_itemize">
<li id="S1.I1.i1" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">First, to develop superfluid visualization, we need prepare appropriate data sets.
As far as we know, there are no publicly-available superfluid flow data sets that could be used for visualization.
Thus, we derive methods to generate superfluid flow data sets for visualization by numerically solving the model equation.
To obtain a stable solution of superfluid flow in 2D, we propose transforming the underlying equation to polar coordinate domain to eliminate the numerically unstable temporal-spatial cross term, and devise a stable hybrid method.
In 3D, rather than develop complicated numerical solver, we instead adopt model approximation and develop an efficient but stable high-order finite difference scheme.</p>
</div>

<li id="S1.I1.i2" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Second, to enhance the visualization quality, we devise a temporal filtering method to suppress the high frequency noise-like waves, <span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">which</span> significantly improves the quality of the data sets, and thus the quality of the visualizations.
Note that this is a very important step, since <span id="S1.I1.i2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">without such a filtering, noise-like waves may seriously influence the vortex identification, which could lead to erroneous visualizations.</span></p>
</div>
</li>
<li id="S1.I1.i3" class="ltx_item" style="list-style-type:none;">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Third, due to the phase singularity of the superfluid model equation at the vortices, existing approaches are difficult to <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">apply</span> for vortex visualization.
Thus, we propose to utilize the singularity instead, and develop a new technique based on velocity circulation when identifying superfluid vortices, especially in 3D.
In theory, we can compute such a circulation along any <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">closed curve</span> around a grid point, and for simplicity, <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">a closed curve on a plane in 3D</span>.
However, <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.4" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">ambiguities</span> in numerical computation of circulation may fail to find certain important vortex structures.
Hence, we devise an orthogonal-plane strategy to obtain <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.5" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">complete</span> circulation values over the field, so that we can faithfully identify a full set of superfluid vortices.
Furthermore, together with filtering (smoothing), we can easily extract <span id="S1.I1.i3.p1.1.6" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">vortex tubes suitable for visualization</span>.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_item">•</span> 
<div id="S1.I1.i4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.I1.i4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Fourth, as a direct application of our techniques, we perform visual study and analysis of superfluid vortices for both steady and unsteady scenarios, and present various superfluid phenomena as our visualization results.
In the steady case, we study superfluids in a rotating frame, and explore the regularly-distributed vortex lattice and vortex ring structures.
In addition, we examine and verify the Feynman relation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite> in 2D in order to verify the appropriateness of the physical model.
In the unsteady case, we study superfluids in an inertial frame, and evolve and visualize vortex strings with reconnections, Kelvin wave formation and transmission, leapfrogging, as well as vortex tangle (a turbulent state of superfluids).
With these visualizations, scientists can obtain higher-quality visual analysis of vortex dynamics for superfluid studies as well as scientific experiments.</p>

<div id="S1.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p9.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we consider different superfluid conditions and produce assorted visualization results, either steady or unsteady; e.g., Fig. <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a> shows the dynamic formation process of a 3D superfluid vortex ring structure discovered and visualized by our method, which has never been observed before; note that the similar result presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> was generated by the numerical simulation technique presented in this paper, but visualized with direct volume rendering of the field magnitude (density), which is less accurate; we will explain later that such visualization is also not generally applicable.
Moreover, we verify and compare our method with related physical models together with domain physicists, with positive expert feedbacks.
Furthermore, this work is the first attempt we are aware of in developing visualization method based on superfluid model simulation data sets; it is useful for visual exploration and analysis of vortex structures in superfluids, and contributes to open a new area of visualization on macroscopic quantum phenomena in fluids.</p>

The formation of superfluid vortices requires certain conditions, e.g., the rotation of the system or the interaction of the vortex rings; when superfluid vortices are formed, they never dissipate locally until they reconnect (where the dissipation comes from the radiating waves at the reconnections), and their topologies can only be changed by the reconnection of vortex lines or the decomposition of a vortex ring into smaller ones.</p>

<p id="S3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Superfluids in rotation.</span>  The rotation of superfluids not only leads to vorticity, but also changes the Hamiltonian of the system.
Hence, superfluid vortices spontaneously arrange into a regular lattice structure in favor of low energy under constant rotation.
Such a non-trivial configuration is a unique characteristic of superfluids from the macroscopic quantum phenomena.</p>

The outer boundary along the radial dimension (not explicitly stored) is treated by a Neumann condition with finite difference discretization.
The above treatments lead to a tridiagonal linear system, which can be solved efficiently in the simulation over time in Fourier domain.
To obtain the final simulation result, we further apply an inverse Fourier transform.</p>

However, this may complicate the solution and introduce excessive computational overhead.
Hence, we make a compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency and adopt a model approximation approach where the current-current formulation is used in 3D simulations with rotation.
In the following, we consider two different scenarios of 3D superfluid simulations:</p>

In detail, we handle the first and second derivatives of both the spatial and temporal terms in Cartesian coordinates by second and fourth order central finite-difference schemes in time and space, respectively, in explicit form and with conditional stability.
Note that high-order spatial discretization should be used to reduce the discretization anisotropy, which may distort the shape of the vortex lattice.
Hence, the discretization leads to the following linear system:</p>

The asymmetry in the initial condition results in complex vortex motion, such as vortex reconnection and Kelvin waves.
However, this initial condition is restricted by the number of vortex lines generated from the 3D rotating superfluids, which is relatively sparse.
Thus, it cannot produce sufficiently dense vortex interaction dynamics, and then vortex tangle.
Moreover, the vortex tangle always decays during interaction, meaning that we will have fewer and fewer vortices as time proceeds.</p>

Since different bands of these waves interfere with one another in different directions, the composed waves look like noise in spatial domain, see Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 3D Simulation ‣ 4 Model Simulation ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (top), which significantly deteriorate the visual inspection of vortices.
In principle, these high-frequency waves are plausible solutions to the NLKG equation.
However, they only act as small-scale compression waves and are of little interest to the domain scientists for studying superfluid vortices, since superfluid vortices are much more structured and stationary with much lower temporal frequency than these noise-like waves.
To get a clearer physical picture, the high-frequency waves must be removed during the simulation.
To address this issue, we may introduce a damping term into the model equation (Eq. <a href="#S3.E1" title="In 3 Superfluid Model ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>) as has been applied in Bose-Einstein condensates simulations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, but this method will result in excessive energy loss and hinder the formation of a vortex lattice, which requires finite <math id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\omega" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">ω</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1.1">𝜔</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.1.m1.1c">\omega</annotation></semantics></math> in the final steady state.</p>

With this temporal filtering, we can significantly enhance the quality of the simulation results (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 3D Simulation ‣ 4 Model Simulation ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a> (bottom)) for better vortex core identification and clear vortex structure visualization.
This filtering technique differs from the traditional filtering methods, since we isolate magnitude and phase as independent components, where it is nontrivial to conduct spectral analysis.
However, this technique has proven to be very effective since the dynamics is described by a complex-valued equation, where the magnitude and phase may have independent modes.
Furthermore, it is easy to see that our technique does not influence the stationary solution, where the magnitude has only the lowest mode with the phase being a single finite mode.</p>

<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After simulating and obtaining the superfluid flow, we can identify vortex cores from the data set in order to extract the vortex structures for visualization.
Note that we aim to visualize the structures for vortex cores only, but not the entire structure of vortices.
Thus, we ignore other structures such as the spiral patterns, which are fluctuating structures around the vortex cores that occur at very small scales.
To overcome the difficulty that superfluid vorticity is singular, our key idea is to employ velocity circulation and develop a specific circulation-based numerical method with an orthogonal-plane strategy to efficiently identify vortex cores while avoiding ambiguity in the circulation computation with accuracy up to the grid resolution.
Here, we want to emphasize that sub-grid scale vortices cannot be faithfully differentiated without ambiguity; we will discuss in more detail later.</p>

It is known from both existing theory and our visualization (see Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 3D Simulation ‣ 4 Model Simulation ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(c)&amp;(d)) that superfluid vortex cores coincide with the singularity in phase space, where the phase value is undefined, e.g., the branch point <span id="S5.SS1.p1.3.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span> in Fig. <a href="#S4.F3" title="Figure 3 ‣ 4.2 3D Simulation ‣ 4 Model Simulation ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">3</span></a>(d).
This is a unique characteristic of the superfluid model different from the classical model, where vortices do not possess singularities for the related physical quantities over the flow field.
In addition, superfluids are potential (irrotational) flows except at the vortex cores, where phase singularities cause the vortices.</p>

However, when vortices undergo reconnections, not only their shapes change topologically, but also energies radiate out, see the red boxes in Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Vortex Core Identification ‣ 5 Vortex Identification and Visualization ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a>, which show a 3D simulation of free-evolving superfluid vortex dynamics after a reconnection.
Such energy radiation significantly affects the superfluid density, so the density iso-contour approach may generate unwanted non-vortex structures and false positive superfluid vortex structures, see Fig. <a href="#S5.F4" title="Figure 4 ‣ 5.2 Vortex Core Identification ‣ 5 Vortex Identification and Visualization ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4</span></a> (a).

Therefore, we align loops with the simulation grid, such that we can simply and exactly fetch the data from the neighborhood grid points.
In 3D, we form loops on axis-aligned planes (either x-, y-, or z-plane) to construct a circulation loop at each grid point.
It is worth to note that when using a small loop, the integral may not be sufficiently accurate due to large variation of the data near the vortex core.
However, when using a large loop, more than one vortex core may be included in the loop and will be identified as a single vortex core, which cannot reflect the true structure of the vortices up to the precision of grid resolution.
As a compromise, we use a small loop confined to an axis-aligned plane, which contains the nearest neighbor of the grid point on that plane as the integral loop, see Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3 Numerical Evaluation ‣ 5 Vortex Identification and Visualization ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>(a), but we discard the four corners to make the loop closer to a circle in order to avoid artifacts that the identified vortex will have a box-shaped cross-section due to a box-like path.

<p id="S5.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that since we use a loop with finite cross-section, we do not expect to locate the vortex cores exactly since they are infinitesimally small.
Instead, we confine the vortex core within a finite tube with approximately twice the size of the grid spacing.
Although we are not sure exactly the location of the vortex core, we are certain that the cross-section includes vortex cores whose mutual distances are smaller than the radius of the cross-section, implying that such a circulation-based scheme involves the aggregate of all small-scale vortices, and the shape of the tube indicates the spatial structure of the vortex cores; such spatial structure can be determined by the grid resolution.
For vortices in sub-grid scale, uncertainties may still occur, which can only be rectified by increasing the grid resolution.</p>

<p id="S5.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In general, a vortex core line may or may not pass through a local circulation loop plane depending on the orientation of the plane.
Since vortex cores may not overlap with the grid points, the numerical evaluation of circulations on planes almost parallel to the orientation of the vortex core lines will give close-to-zero value; hence, the detection of a portion of the vortex core lines may fail, and the grid point may be mis-identified as a non-vortex point.
Fig. <a href="#S5.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 5.3 Numerical Evaluation ‣ 5 Vortex Identification and Visualization ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a> (a) shows the vortex core line in orange (arrow) and two parallel circulation planes at grid points <span id="S5.SS3.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span> and <span id="S5.SS3.p5.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">B</span>.
At <span id="S5.SS3.p5.1.3" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">A</span>, the vortex core line passes through the loop on the circulation plane, so we can successfully identify the vortex core.
However, at the nearby point <span id="S5.SS3.p5.1.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">B</span>, since the local vortex core line is parallel to the circulation plane, the vortex core identification fails even though the figure suggests the existence of a vortex core at <span id="S5.SS3.p5.1.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">B</span>.
Such ambiguous case becomes indistinguishable from the real case of a non-vortex point.</p>

Note that these three orthogonal planes form a complete set of basis planes that can be used to construct any planes that pass through a grid point for circulation evaluation.
This means that vortex core lines that pass through the vicinity of a grid point with arbitrary orientation can be effectively captured by the circulation values from at least one of the three evaluations.</p>

<p id="S5.SS4.p1.1" class="ltx_p">After vortex identification, we obtain a binary field to indicate <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">whether each grid point is a vortex point or not</span>, and we perform vortex visualization based on such a field.
Note that since we compute circulation with a loop size of two grid cells for vortex identification, such a binary field only indicates whether there are vortex cores <span id="S5.SS4.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">inside the loop</span>, and there is almost no chance for a grid point to be exactly the vortex core.
On the other hand, vortex cores are infinitesimally small, but visualizing them requires structures with finite size, usually using a tube structure.
Thus, locating exactly the vortex core position is not necessary for visualization, and the binary field already forms a good candidate set for vortex tube generation， which can be used for visualization based on iso-surface extraction and rendering.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p2.2" class="ltx_p">However, if we directly use this binary field to generate the vortex tube, severe spatial aliasing artifacts (note that such aliasing is due to insufficient spatial sampling and is different from those noise-like waves in Section <a href="#S4.SS3" title="4.3 Temporal Filtering ‣ 4 Model Simulation ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">4.3</span></a>) would occur because the binary field is like a rectangle function which is discontinuous across the edges.
To remove aliasing, we apply a Laplacian-diffusion filter with several iterations to smooth the binary field, which effectively removes the high frequency components beyond the sampling rate.
Hence, we can generate the vortex tubes by extracting iso-surfaces from such a smoothed field.
In our visualizations, we construct the vortex tube iso-surfaces based on an iso-value (ranged <math id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2" class="ltx_Math" alttext="[0,1]" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2a"><mrow id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.2" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml"><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.1" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">[</mo><mn id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">0</mn><mo id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.2" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">,</mo><mn id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.2" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml">1</mn><mo stretchy="false" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.2.3" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml">]</mo></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2b"><interval closure="closed" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.3.2"><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.1.1">0</cn><cn type="integer" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.2.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2.2">1</cn></interval></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p2.1.m1.2c">[0,1]</annotation></semantics></math>) that relates to the radius of the vortex tube, and we set it as <math id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="0.5" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1a"><mn id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">0.5</mn><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1b"><cn type="float" id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1.1">0.5</cn></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.SS4.p2.2.m2.1c">0.5</annotation></semantics></math>, but it can be varied to make the tube thicker or thinner, but no thicker than several cells depending on the degree of smoothing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.SS4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS4.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that the purpose of such a smoothing is to remove aliasing artifacts arisen from the sampling of high frequency signals.
Since the smoothing filter is isotropic, the vortex tube generated from the smoothed field still represents the vortex core structure.
However, smoothing may introduce uncertainty to visualization, e.g., very close vortex tubes may be merged into one vortex tube. However, these uncertainties are restricted in scales which are roughly smaller than the size of the smoothing kernel.
To maintain faithful vortex structure, the above smoothing cannot be excessive.
To control the degree of smoothing, we control the kernel size of the Laplacian-diffusion filter as well as the number of iterations, which can be fine-tuned empirically.</p>

It is clear that the spatial distribution of the vortex lattice structure is quite similar between the real experiment and our simulation (see the triangle shapes formed by the vortex cores, and the repeated hexagonal structure of nearby vortex cores for each vortex core).
However, the two results cannot be made exactly matchable since it is difficult to use the same conditions and system parameters for both experiment and simulation.
Nevertheless, the close similarity of the vortex lattice distribution gives strong support for the correctness of the simulation as well as the underlying physical model.</p>

In particular, we study two important local vortex dynamics that form the basis of the global vortex dynamics: the <span id="S6.SS2.p1.6.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">vortex-vortex reconnection</span> and <span id="S6.SS2.p1.6.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">the Kelvin wave formation and transmission</span>.

<p id="S6.SS2.p2.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Local vortex reconnection.</span>  Although global vortex dynamics (including vortex tangle) in superfluids is rather complicated, it can be decomposed into several characteristic basic local dynamics.
One of them is the local vortex reconnection illustrated in Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>(a).
From the figure, it is clear that when two vortex strings are close to each other at certain velocity, they may collide.
The result of the collision will be a re-organization of the vortex string topology by combining the old vortex strings and reproducing the new ones.
Such reconnection phenomenon has been observed experimentally in superfluid liquid Helium <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite>, see results in Fig. <a href="#S6.F13" title="Figure 13 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">13</span></a>; we can see that our simulated and visualized results can produce similar dynamics, as compared to Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>(a).</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Note that like the comparison for vortex lattice formation, it is difficult to have exactly the same side-by-side comparison for the vortex reconnection between experiment and simulation since it is hard to have the same system conditions and parameter settings.
However, we can still make some comparison and find out the similarity between their spatial topological structures, which gives strong evidence that the model equation we use and simulation methods we develop conform to the real physics.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Kelvin wave.</span>  Another important basic local dynamics is the Kelvin wave formation and transmission, which can be easily triggered and observed when vortex structures reconnect.
Here, we demonstrate this phenomenon with Fig. <a href="#S6.F12" title="Figure 12 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">12</span></a>(b), where a vortex ring approaches a vortex line.
After colliding with the vortex line, the vortex ring will be absorbed and a proportion of its energy will be sent out in the form of helical Kelvin waves from the collision points to the two sides of the vortex line.
Finally, due to the periodic boundary condition, the waves will collide with its two wavefronts along the vortex line and a new vortex ring will be “split out” from the vortex line but with smaller ring size, revealing that Kelvin wave is actually a driving force for successive reconnection events in superfluids.</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p5.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS2.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Global vortex dynamics.</span>  We produce global vortex dynamics in a non-rotating system using initial vortex lines taken from intermediate solutions of a 3D rotating superfluid simulation.
Without rotation, the vortices will not remain steady and will evolve freely over time, see Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>.
Long vortex lines will be further split by vortex reconnections into shorter vortex lines, and as time proceeds, merging process will also happen to reconnect shorter vortex lines into longer ones.
Such split and merge may exist simultaneously in the domain, and the whole process iterates over time to produce more complicated vortex structures with irregular topology, see Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a>(b).</p>

<p id="S6.SS2.p6.1" class="ltx_p">It is important to note that during each vortex reconnection in global vortex dynamics, some energy will be released out from the vortices in the form of waves, see Fig. <a href="#S6.F15" title="Figure 15 ‣ 6.2 Unsteady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">15</span></a> for a corresponding zoom-in view produced by using direct volume rendering.
It is such energy release that decays the vortices in the whole system, see again Fig. <a href="#S6.F11" title="Figure 11 ‣ 6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">11</span></a> (a &amp; b).

In the case of superfluids, due to zero viscosity, vortices do not merge or dissipate, thus leading to more stable and long-lasting leapfrogging phenomena.

<p id="S6.SS3.p3.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p3.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Initialization.</span>
In general, we require the initialization to contain large enough circulation, but we can use different distributions of the field, which does not influence the final vortex phenomena, for no matter steady or unsteady superfluid vortex dynamics.
For steady solutions on rotating superfluids, the solution always converges to the steady <span id="S6.SS3.p3.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">vortex lattice (or vortex ring in 3D) structure</span>, while for unsteady solutions, we are interested in either local dynamics (such as reconnections and Kelvin waves) or vortex tangle.
In either case, <span id="S6.SS3.p3.1.3" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">although some initial conditions are
artificial, the underlying motions are strictly under the corresponding physical law by the model, which can result in believable phenomena that could be observed in practice, and our method can produce some phenomena that can be truly observed in real experiments.</span></p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p4.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p4.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Accuracy analysis.</span>
Since we use high-order numerical methods in both 2D and 3D, the original discretization of the model equation is accurate enough for visualization purpose， especially if we use high resolution grid.
However, due to strong waves which are eventually of high frequency, we employ a temporal filtering method to make the simulation data clear enough for vortex identification.
This is based on an assumption that vortices and compression waves are completely separable in time frequency.
However, if there are vortices that vary as fast as waves, these vortices will be removed, which introduces a certain degree of uncertainty in our final results.
However, by our experiments and observations, such phenomenon is very rare <span id="S6.SS3.p4.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">in most cases</span>, as the waves are finally of extremely high frequency everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p5.1" class="ltx_p">On the other hand, during vortex visualization, we employ circulation with a loop size of two grid cells to identify the vortex cores.
Here, we also make an assumption that all the vortex cores are of the same scale, which is true for superfluids and in contrast to classical fluids where vortices can have varying scales.
With circulation-based approach, we are uncertain about the exact location of the vortex core, where some small-scale (scale smaller than two grid cells) variation of the vortex structure is missing.
However, we are sure that the vortex tubes we generated and visualized can truly reflect the large scale (scale larger than two grid cells) structure of the vortex variations since the vortex cores are completely included inside the circulation loops.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.SS3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.SS3.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Since large-scale structures are more meaningful than small fluctuations for most of the cases, the visualization we generated can be useful enough for scientific comparison and visual analysis, as done in Sections <a href="#S6.SS1" title="6.1 Steady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.1</span></a> &amp; <a href="#S6.SS2" title="6.2 Unsteady Vortex Dynamics ‣ 6 Visual Analysis ‣ Towards High-quality Visualization of Superfluid Vortices" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">6.2</span></a>.
For more accurate analysis involving smaller-scale structures, we only need to increase the grid resolution, and our vortex identification and visualization methods can automatically obtain smaller scale structures since the circulation loop is always of two grid cell size.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p7.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p7.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Feedback from physicists.</span>  Our visualization results have been given to two research groups of superfluid scientists for feedback.
One of such groups are our collaborators at Nanyang Technological University, led by Professor Emeritus Kerson Huang from MIT, who are all theoretical physicists.
They felt that our visualizations and animations have more intuitively helped them observe the superfluid structure from the physical model, which has given them deeper understanding, especially in 3D, and find out more interesting and useful properties for superfluid vortices, as evidenced by a recent
paper published by the group <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>.
Another group of scientists are from the research group led by Professor Daniel Lathrop at University of Maryland, who are all experimental scientists on superfluids.
They gave us very positive feedback for our simulation and visualization results, with a particular interest on Kelvin wave simulation and visualization.
With our results, both groups of scientists can easily analyze the steady and unsteady behavior of superfluid vortices on a computer, and even discover new vortex structures more intuitively by trying different sets of system parameters.
This can provide some guidance in experimental observations, <span id="S6.SS3.p7.1.2" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">which indicates the significance of our simulation and visualization work to help support research in fundamental science</span>.</p>

<p id="S6.SS3.p8.1" class="ltx_p"><span id="S6.SS3.p8.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Limitations.</span>
Since the vortex cores exist as singularities in the phase field of the NLKG equation and are infinitesimally small, we cannot exactly locate them and visualize them with thin-enough structures at proper grid resolution.
In addition, our visualization of superfluid vortices is done by extracting iso-surfaces of a smoothed circulation field, and the vortex tube size is larger than the grid spacing.
Thus, very dense vortex tangles cannot be visualized clearly.
Increasing the grid resolution can alleviate such problem and make the tube thinner to better reflect the vortex core geometry, but at the expense of more computing resource and time.
Finally, the Laplacian smoothing on the circulation field may also remove some vortices given the limited grid resolution.</p>

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we aim for high-quality superfluid visualization and <span id="S7.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text" style="color:#000000;">to help our collaborators visually study superfluid vortices.</span>
To achieve this goal, we solve the underlying nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation to prepare proper datasets for visualization, and develop an effective vortex core identification method based on a particular loop selection model and an orthogonal-plane strategy, which are local and efficient for parallel implementation on GPU.
Visual analysis of superfluid vortex structures is conducted with domain experts by considering both steady and unsteady scenarios, where we observe vortex lattice and ring structures in 2D &amp; 3D, approximate the Feynman relation in 2D, and produce local vortex reconnections, Kelvin waves, vortex tangles and leapfrogging phenomena in 3D.
These results helped physicists to better understand the stationary as well as dynamic properties of superfluid vortices.
For verification purpose, we compared our visualization with experimental results and the Feynman relation.</p>

<p id="S7.p2.1" class="ltx_p">As a future work, we would like to explore the use of adaptive grids to produce higher resolution vortex core regions to more accurately locate vortex cores and reveal finer-scale structures.
Such result will be useful for comparative studies with real experiments.
Moreover, we plan to explore multi-scale visualization, where we visualize small-scale vortex core structures on top of large-scale structures for studying the relation and interaction between vortex core structures across different scales.</p>
