<p id="id18.id1" class="ltx_p">Forensic application of automatically matching skull with face images is an important research area linking biometrics with practical applications in forensics. It is an opportunity for biometrics and face recognition researchers to help the law enforcement and forensic experts in giving an identity to unidentified human skulls. It is an extremely challenging problem which is further exacerbated due to lack of any publicly available database related to this problem. This is the first research in this direction with a two-fold contribution: (i) introducing the first of its kind skull-face image pair database, IdentifyMe, and (ii) presenting a preliminary approach using the proposed semi-supervised formulation of transform learning. The experimental results and comparison with existing algorithms showcase the challenging nature of the problem. We assert that the availability of the database will inspire researchers to build sophisticated skull-to-face matching algorithms.</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">This case and several other such cases show that identification is not only required by the living people but it is also important for the dead. Identification for the living has been well studied and multiple biometric modalities provide efficient and accurate methods for identification. However, dead bodies and remains of individuals who have suffered unfortunate death due to crime or natural calamities, often do not have the luxury of having biometrics modalities intact. Fingerprints <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> and iris <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> may be decomposed while dental and DNA patterns may not exist in medical or national identification databases. Further, there are several cases where only some body parts are available, for instance head, hand or leg. While the bones in hand or leg can be used to determine DNA and, to a certain extent ethnicity and gender as well, however, forensic experts can reconstruct a lot more information if the skull is available. They can determine the DNA, age, gender (depending on the age), and reconstruct the entire face which may be very useful in forensic and law enforcement investigation.</p>

<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">This research paper explores how the biometrics and face recognition community can help forensic experts in identifying the person from the skull. Given the skull of a person, forensic experts first determine the age, gender and ethnicity of the person using several morphological measures <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, followed by generating the facial reconstruction from the skull using clay sculpture. This process is generally performed manually; however, recently some of the labs have started using 3D reconstruction software such as FaceIT and ReFace <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. Figure <a href="#S1.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ On Matching Skulls to Digital Face Images: A Preliminary Approach" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a> shows the skeleton, clay reconstruction, and original face images (from left to right) from two solved cases<span id="footnote2" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">2</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">2</span>http://catyanaskoryfalsetti.com/forensic-art/</span></span></span> <span id="footnote3" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">3</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">3</span>https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/about-us/lab/forensic-science-communications/fsc/jan2001/phillips.htm</span></span></span>. This process, when performed manually, takes a little over a week for one skull while generating computerized 3D reconstruction takes 3-4 days. Given this process, face matching can be performed in two ways: (i) matching the skull with face images, and (ii) matching the composite with face images. Matching reconstructed composite with face images might appear easier, however it requires an expert forensic anthropologist and at least 3-4 days for generating the composite.</p>

<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In this research, we examine the feasibility of matching skull to face images, that may be available in a missing person database. We postulate that matching skull to face images can be considered as another dimension/covariate in heterogeneous face recognition research with forensic applications. The first and foremost requirement of pursuing this research is a database of skull and corresponding face images. Therefore, we first prepared the <span id="S1.p5.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IdentifyMe - Skull and Face Image Database</span> which contains mated pairs of skull and face images from 35 individuals and 429 independent skull images. The database will be released to the research community to promote further research in this area. We next propose a preliminary algorithm using transform learning to match skull with face images, along with establishing the baseline skull-to-face matching performance of several existing algorithms. The results show that the problem at hand is a challenging yet feasible research problem, requiring creation of a larger database and specifically designed algorithms to correctly determine the identity of the person with high accuracy/precision.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">While existing research has focused on creating facial reconstructions from skulls, no work has been done to automate the matching of skull images to digital face images. This is the first work which aims to match a given skull image to a large number of face images to retrieve the identity of the given skull image. Due to the lack of an existing dataset for the above problem, we have prepared the proposed <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IdentifyMe</span> dataset. The proposed dataset contains 464 skull images, and is divided into two parts: (i) skull and digital face image pairs, and (ii) unlabeled supplementary skull images. The first component consists of pairs collected from real world examples of solved skull identification cases, while the second part contains unlabeled skull images. Details of the two components of the proposed IdentifyMe dataset are provided below:</p>

<p id="S2.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">A total of 35 skull images and their corresponding face images are collected from various sources. Some of these pairs correspond to real world cases where a skull was found and later identified to belong to a missing person.

While it is difficult to obtain skull-digital image pairs, however, one can also obtain unlabeled skull images from the Internet. Although the identities of the skull images of this component are unknown, these set of images can be utilized for unsupervised learning based algorithms. Owing to the heterogeneity of the problem, and large variations observed between the domains of digital face images and skulls, this component of unlabeled supplementary skull images can thus be used to reduce the domain gap between the two.</p>

We will first ensure that the images are not already available in the database and then release the new set of images as part of the database with acknowledgment to the contributors. This will ensure incremental growth in the resources and foster research in the domain of skull to digital face image matching.</p>

<p id="S2.SS3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In order to standardize further research on skull to digital photo matching, two protocols are provided for the proposed dataset. In real world scenarios of missing person, it is unlikely for law enforcement agencies to perform face verification (1:1 matching) with skull images. Therefore, two identification protocols are defined on the proposed dataset. Each protocol consists of five-fold cross validation in order to remove any bias of a particular train-test partition. As is the case in real world, the digital photos correspond to the gallery images (or the database), and the skull images correspond to the probes. The two protocols are defined as follows:</p>

Therefore, in order to mimic this real world scenario, the second protocol consists of an extended gallery, where 993 additional digital images are added in the gallery (to obtain a gallery of 1000 images). Therefore, each fold in this protocol consists of 1000 gallery images (digital face images) and 7 probe images (skull images).</p>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S3.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For skull to face matching, there are two major restrictions in building automated algorithms: (i) limited training samples per subject and (ii) overall limited training data. Due to the sensitive nature of the problem, getting multiple training samples from each subject is exceptionally challenging. The problem is further exacerbated with availability of limited labeled training data (specifically, no training data before this research). Therefore, data intensive algorithms such as deep learning will be extremely demanding and may overfit. On the other hand, algorithms which do not require training such as handcrafted features or relatively less training such as dictionary learning or transform learning can be explored. In this research, we propose transform learning based skull to face matching by utilizing the domain specific knowledge (i.e. face) and problem specific knowledge (i.e. skull).</p>

For the proposed transform learning algorithm, results are presented with both Unsupervised Transform Learning (US-TL) and Semi-Supervised Transform Learning (SS-TL). Since the proposed models can extract features from any input data, results are shown with raw pixels (images as it is) and HOG features as input. Data augmentation is performed on the gallery images by flipping across the y-axis and varying the brightness.</p>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Determining the identity of human remains, particularly skull, is a long standing problem in forensic applications. Forensic experts first create a facial reconstruction from the skull using clay technique or computerized 3D methods. The composite can then be shared with the media and matched across already available face databases including the missing person database. This research attempts to build an algorithm for matching skull to digital face images. A novel database, <span id="S5.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">IdentifyMe</span> database, has been prepared by the authors which consists of more than 450 skull images, including 35 real world skull-face image pairs. Two protocols emulating the real world scenarios, along with their baseline results have also been reported to facilitate research in this direction. Due to the difference in information content of skull and digital images, a Semi-Supervised Transform Learning (SS-TL) algorithm has been proposed for performing identification of skull images. For both the protocols, the proposed SS-TL algorithm achieves improved performance, in comparison with other baseline results. In order to encourage further research in this area, the IdentifyMe dataset will be made publicly available to the research community as a <span id="S5.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">contributory</span> dataset, wherein, other researchers would be encouraged to contribute and use the dataset.</p>
