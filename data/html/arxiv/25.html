<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we present a grasp planner which integrates two sources of information to generate robust grasps for a robotic hand. First, the topological information of the object model is incorporated by building the mean curvature skeleton and segmenting the object accordingly in order to identify object regions which are suitable for applying a grasp.
Second, the local surface structure is investigated to construct feasible and robust grasping poses by aligning the hand according to the local object shape.
We show how this information can be used to derive different grasping strategies, which also allows to distinguish between precision and power grasps. We applied the approach to a wide variety of object models of the KIT and the YCB real-world object model databases and evaluated the approach with several robotic hands. The results show that the skeleton-based grasp planner is capable to autonomously generate high-quality grasps in an efficient manner.
In addition, we evaluate how robust the planned grasps are against hand positioning errors as they occur in real-world applications due to perception and actuation inaccuracies.
The evaluation shows that the majority of the generated grasps are of high quality since they can be successfully applied even when the hand is not exactly positioned.</p>

<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The ability to robustly plan feasible grasps for arbitrary objects is an important capability of autonomous robots in the context of mobile manipulation. It allows to generate grasping configurations in an autonomous and unsupervised manner based on the object’s 3D mesh information.
Part-based grasp planning is an approach to deal with the complexity of arbitrary shaped objects by segmenting them into simpler parts which are more suitable for shape analysis for grasp generation. This procedure complies also with the behavior of humans which prefer to structure objects into smaller segments (see e.g. the recognition-by-components paradigm of Biederman <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>).
Representing an object by its parts fits very well to robotic grasp planning, since a robotic gripper or hand can usually only grasp an object by accessing a local surface area for establishing contacts.</p>

<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">The part-based grasp planner presented in this work is based on the assumption that an object can be segmented according to its skeleton structure. The object skeleton simplifies the topological representation and provides information about the connectivity of the segments.
Object segmentation is realized by analyzing the skeleton according to branches and crossings in the topology.
The object segments are analyzed separately to determine if several grasping strategies (e.g. power or precision grasps) can be applied according to the local surface information (see <a href="#S1.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ I Introduction ‣ Planning High-Quality Grasps using Mean Curvature Object Skeletons" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Figure 1</span></a>).</p>

<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Since robustness is essential for robotic grasp planning, it is desirable to plan grasps which can be executed robustly in realistic setups. Hence, we aim at planning grasps that are robust to disturbances and inaccuracies as they appear during execution due to noise in perception and actuation. In this work, we show that the analysis of the object skeleton in combination with the usage of local surface properties leads to grasping hypotheses which are robust to inaccuracies in robot hand positioning, which indicates a reliable execution on real robot platforms. An implementation of the presented grasp planning approach based on the Simox library <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> is provided as C++ open source project<span id="footnote1" class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>https://gitlab.com/Simox/simox-cgal</span></span></span>.</p>

<p id="S2.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Napier divided hand movements in humans into <span id="S2.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">prehensive movements</span> and <span id="S2.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">non-prehensive movements</span> to distinguish between suitable and non-suitable grasping movements <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>.
He showed that prehensive grasping movements of the hand consist of two basic patterns which he termed precision grasp and power grasp.
Based on this work Cutkosky developed a grasp taxonomy which distinguishes between 16 different grasping types <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite>.
The transfer of grasping strategies in humans to robotic applications is usually done by reducing the complexity, e.g. by considering a low number of grasp types (i.e. power and precision grasp) or by using the Eigengrasp approach which is capable of approximating human grasping movements with low degree of freedom spaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>

Analytical approaches are based on geometrical properties and/or kinematic or dynamic formulations, whereas data driven approaches rely on simulation. The complexity of the problem is often reduced by utilizing randomized methods and by considering simplified contact models.
Data-driven approaches also make use of simulation environments such as <span id="S2.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Graspit!</span> <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite>, OpenRave <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>, and Simox <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite> to generate and evaluate grasping poses.

<p id="S2.p3.1" class="ltx_p">The execution of such grasps with real robot hands is challenging since small disturbances, as they appear during real-world execution, could quickly lead to unstable grasping configurations as shown in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. It has been shown that such potential inaccuracies in execution can be considered during grasp planning by analyzing small variations of the generated grasping pose.</p>

<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In part-based grasp planning there exists several approaches which consider parts of the object for grasp synthesis.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite> the object is approximated by a set of primitive shapes (box, cylinder, sphere, cone) to which manually defined hand configurations can be assigned.
A similar approach has been presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>. The object is decomposed in superquadrics and several heuristics are used to generate the grasping information.
In <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> the object is decomposed based on Minimal Volume Bounding Boxes. grasping information is synthesised on the resulting bounding boxes. An extension of this work is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> where neural networks are used to combine 3D and 2D grasping strategies.
The grasp planner presented in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> is operating on a topological object segmentation which is computed based on the Reeb Graph formalism. The resulting object segments are used for randomized grasp generation.
Independent Contact Regions can be used to determine surface areas that are suitable for grasping <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>.
An voxelized object representation is used by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite> to plan feasible grasps via hand-object geometric fitting strategies.</p>

<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Our previous work described in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>, <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite> is related to the work we present here since it uses the medial axis transform as a simplified object representation on which grasp planning is performed. The medial axis representation is computed on point clouds or mesh data and provides information about the object structure and object symmetries. Before grasp planning can be performed, the medial axis transform is processed via cluster algorithms and transferred to grid-based data structures on which grasp synthesis is realized based on several heuristics for typical grid structures. In contrast to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">21</a>]</cite>, we use mean curvature skeletons <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">22</a>]</cite> to represent the object structure. Compared to the medial axis approach, this representation results in a reduced complexity while preserving full object surface information (see Section <a href="#S3" title="III Object Skeletons ‣ Planning High-Quality Grasps using Mean Curvature Object Skeletons" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">III</span></a>). We exploit the skeleton structure for object segmentation and in Section <a href="#S4" title="IV Part-based Grasp Planning ‣ Planning High-Quality Grasps using Mean Curvature Object Skeletons" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">IV</span></a> we show how the object segments can be analyzed for part-based grasp planning. The approach is evaluated in Section <a href="#S5" title="V Evaluation ‣ Planning High-Quality Grasps using Mean Curvature Object Skeletons" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">V</span></a> on several object data sets by investigating the force closure rate and the robustness of the generated grasps according to <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite>. In addition, we compare the results to a randomized grasp planning algorithm which aligns the approach direction to the object surface <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, similar to the approach used in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite>.</p>

In both figures, the approach direction is projected along the negative approach direction onto the object surface. It can be seen that a <span id="S4.I3.i1.p1.5.7" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">round</span> local surface results in uniformly sampled orientations (in this example, there are eight directions generated for an endpoint, respectively 16 for a skeleton point on a connecting segment).

Based on the skeleton points, the set of approach directions and the hand approach vector of the GCP, a set of hand orientations is computed which are used to position the hand in the next step.</p>

<p id="S5.SS1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The first evaluation concerns the performance of the developed approach in terms of efficiency and force closure rate. In <a href="#S5.T2" title="TABLE II ‣ V-A Efficiency and Force-Closure Rate ‣ V Evaluation ‣ Planning High-Quality Grasps using Mean Curvature Object Skeletons" class="ltx_ref ltx_refmacro_autoref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">Table II</span></a>, the results of the reference planning approach and the skeleton-based grasp planner are shown for the ARMAR-III hand, the Schunk Dexterous Hand, and the Shadow Dexterous Hand.
The table shows the measured mean values together with the standard deviation over all grasps that were generated on all 83 considered objects.
The time that is needed for generating a valid grasp directly depends on the complexity of the involved 3D models of the hand since many collision and distance calculations need to be performed when closing the fingers for contact detection.
The comparison shows that the skeleton-based approach outperforms the surface-based planner in terms of efficiency (time needed to generate a grasping pose) and force-closure rate (number of force-closure grasps in relation to all generated grasps).

Although we cannot provide any numbers on the <span id="S5.SS1.p2.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">human-likeness</span> of the generated grasps, the underlying algorithm produces good grasps in this sense since the robot hand is aligned with the structure of the object’s shape.</p>

<div id="S6.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this work, we presented a grasp planning approach which takes into account global and local object properties to generate stable and robust grasping information for robotic hands. Global information is gathered by analyzing the object’s mean curvature skeleton in order to identify suitable regions for applying a grasp. In addition, local information is used to select the grasp type and to align the hand according to local skeleton and surface properties.
We showed that the approach is capable of generating high quality grasping information for real-world objects as they occur in object modeling databases such as the KIT or the YCB object DB projects.
We evaluated the approach to a wide variety of objects with different robot hand models and showed that the resulting grasps are more robust in the presence of inaccuracies in grasp execution compared to grasp planners which do not consider local object properties.
In addition, we think that if we compare the results of our grasp planner to the results of other approaches, the generated grasping poses look more natural, i.e. more human like, although we did not perform a qualitative evaluation in this sense. In future work, this aspect will be investigated, e.g. with methods provided in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib28" title="" class="ltx_ref">28</a>]</cite> or <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib29" title="" class="ltx_ref">29</a>]</cite>.</p>
