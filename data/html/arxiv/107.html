<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">Studying the effects of groups of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as in a gene,
genetic pathway, or network, can provide novel insight into complex diseases, above that
which can be gleaned from studying SNPs individually.
Common challenges in set-based genetic association testing include weak effect sizes,
correlation between SNPs in a SNP-set, and scarcity of signals, with single-SNP effects
often ranging from extremely sparse to moderately sparse in number.
Motivated by these challenges, we propose the Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) test for
the association between a SNP-set and outcome.
The GBJ extends the Berk-Jones (BJ) statistic by accounting for correlation among
SNPs, and it provides advantages over the Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC) test
when signals in a SNP-set are moderately sparse.
We also provide an analytic p-value calculation procedure for SNP-sets of any finite size.
Using this p-value calculation, we illustrate that the rejection region for GBJ can be described
as a compromise of those for BJ and GHC.
We develop an omnibus statistic as well, and we show that this omnibus test is robust to
the degree of signal sparsity.
An additional advantage of our method is the ability to conduct inference using individual
SNP summary statistics from a genome-wide association study.
We evaluate the finite sample performance of the GBJ though simulation studies and
application to gene-level association analysis of breast cancer risk.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying the
associations between thousands of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and
a variety of complex traits <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Manolio et al., <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">2009</a>)</cite>.
A traditional GWAS analysis tests for the effect of each individual SNP, and this
approach has shown that single-SNP effects are often weak across the genome
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Visscher et al., <a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>.
Recently, set-based tests which jointly analyze a group of SNPs - e.g. SNPs in a
gene, pathway, or network - have become increasingly popular as complementary
tools which can boost analysis power in GWAS <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">2010</a>)</cite>.
These tests are also standard for rare variant analysis in whole genome sequencing
studies <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Lee et al., <a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">2014</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">SNPs can be aggregated into sets based on a variety of genomic features.
For example, they can be grouped by physical position, such as location in a gene
or Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) block, or similar biological functions, such as membership
in a genetic pathway or protein network.
Set-based analyses then allow for some natural advantages over individual SNP methods.
Besides reducing the number of multiple comparisons across the genome, SNP-set
methods can increase power by pooling sparse and weak effects into a stronger aggregated
signal, as well as by incorporating biological information into the test <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.
In addition, set-based interpretations of association may be more meaningful than their
single-marker counterparts, such as in a gene-level or pathway-level analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">A number of set-based tests for genetic association studies have been developed in
recent years, including burden tests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Li and Leal, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>, the Sequence Kernel Association
Test (SKAT) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Wu et al., <a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>, the minimum p-value test (MinP) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Conneely and Boehnke, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, and most
recently the Generalized Higher Criticism (GHC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Barnett et al., <a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
SKAT and burden tests are examples of methods more suitable for detecting dense signals.
If the signals reside in only a few SNPs that are not correlated with noise SNPs, then
the power of SKAT and burden tests will suffer.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">While certain SNP-sets may contain a large number of signals, it is more common that
genomic constructs formed with GWAS data will have only a few signal SNPs.
Interestingly, within tests designed for this sparse alternative setting, there are still subtle differences
in performance.
Under extreme sparsity, as in the case of only one or very few signals in the entire set, the
minimum p-value test and the GHC have good power for detecting a SNP-set effect.
However GHC and MinP can lose power under moderate sparsity settings, which are
relatively common in gene and pathway level analyses of GWAS data.
For example, in the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) GWAS for
breast cancer risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Hunter et al., <a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>, four out of 42 SNPs in the FGFR2 gene, a known
breast cancer risk loci, showed strong evidence of association without reaching
genome-wide significance.
It is hence of substantial interest to develop testing procedures that can reliably detect
associations across a range of alternatives in the sparse signal regime.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">When factors in a set are independent, several goodness-of-fit type methods have been
proposed to perform set-based tests in the presence of sparse signals <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Donoho and Jin, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>; Jager and Wellner, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Walther, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>)</cite>.
These methods test for the effect of a set by aggregating evidence from marginal test
statistics, and they have been shown to possess attractive asymptotic properties when
the size of a set goes to infinity.
Specifically, they reach a so-called detection boundary when signals are sparse.
In a certain sense, they are able to detect the weakest signals detectable by any
statistical procedure under the sparse alternative.
The class of tests with this ability includes the Higher Criticism (HC) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Donoho and Jin, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> and
the Berk-Jones (BJ) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Berk and Jones, <a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">1979</a>)</cite>.
Compared to the HC and BJ tests, the minimum p-value test, for example, is known
to attain the detection boundary over a smaller portion of the sparse regime.
In terms of finite sample performance, it has been demonstrated through simulation
that Berk-Jones outperforms Higher Criticism over a range of moderately sparse
alternatives when marginal test statistics are independent <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Walther, <a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">2013</a>; Li and Siegmund, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">2015</a>)</cite>.
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Donoho and Jin, (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> provide an explanation for this result by showing that HC disproportionately
weights evidence from the most extreme observed marginal test statistic, at the cost
of losing sensitivity to detect signals in other locations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p6.1" class="ltx_p">However, a direct application of BJ to SNP-set testing is not desirable, as standard
p-value calculations for BJ rely on independence between elements in a set <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Moscovich-Eiger and Nadler, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">2017</a>)</cite>.
This assumption is violated by LD-induced correlation between neighboring SNPs
in a SNP-set.
In addition, we will see that even if we correct the inference procedure of the Berk-Jones,
the power of BJ can fall dramatically in high LD settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p7.1" class="ltx_p">To overcome the challenges posed by correlated SNPs, this paper proposes the
Generalized Berk-Jones (GBJ) statistic for testing the association between a SNP-set
and outcome.
GBJ accounts for LD among SNPs in a set while still preserving the ability to detect
moderately sparse and weak signals in finite samples.
In fact, GBJ reduces to the Berk-Jones statistic when all SNPs in a set are independent.
GBJ can also be applied to SNP-set tests using both individual-level genotype data
or GWAS summary statistics from single SNP analysis.
To facilitate use, we additionally provide an analytic p-value calculation for GBJ.
Our method is more computationally efficient than permutation and is shown to
be accurate even at the extremely small levels required for genome-wide significance.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p8.1" class="ltx_p">Additional insight into the strengths and weaknesses of GBJ is provided by studying
the rejection regions of SNP-set tests developed for sparse alternatives.
The rejection regions allow us to quantitatively describe how the power of each test is
susceptible to changes in parameters such as the amount of correlation between
SNPs or the size of the SNP-set.
Since in practice we never have knowledge of the type of alternative, we also
propose an omnibus test that combines GBJ, GHC, MinP, and SKAT for added
robustness to different degrees of sparsity.
An extensive simulation study demonstrates that GBJ outperforms alternative
methods in testing SNP-set effects when signals are weak and moderately sparse,
and we also show that the omnibus test is robust to a wide range of sparsity levels.</p>

In this case, the standard Berk-Jones statistic no longer has a meaningful interpretation,
and we may expect it to lose efficiency.
In fact, we will show later that the rejection region of the Berk-Jones has a less desirable
shape under various correlation structures, leading to a significant loss in power when
the test statistics are not independent.
Therefore we are interested in developing a modified BJ statistic that can account for
correlation among the marginal test statistics in a set and thus possesses rejection regions
which are more robust to arbitrary correlation structures.</p>

there is no uniformly optimal test for both sparse and dense alternatives.
Since signal sparsity varies between genes, the best test will also change from gene to gene, but it is unknown prior to
scanning the genome.
Thus we propose an omnibus test that offers robust power over a range of
different sparsity levels.</p>

In finite samples, MinP can have better power than the other three tests when there
are only one or two causal SNPs.
In contrast, SKAT is known to have high power when signals in a SNP-set are dense.</p>

While standard methods for inference on HC and BJ are invalid in the presence of
correlation, valid p-values for these tests can be computed with the same ideas
we have introduced for GBJ inference, specifically following equations (<a href="#S3.E5" title="In 3.4 Analytic P-value Calculation ‣ 3 The Generalized Berk-Jones Test for SNP-Set Effects ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>)-(<a href="#S3.E7" title="In 3.4 Analytic P-value Calculation ‣ 3 The Generalized Berk-Jones Test for SNP-Set Effects ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">7</span></a>).
Thus we can show that HC and BJ sometimes have much less desirable
rejection regions when SNPs in a set are correlated.</p>

and GBJ boundaries quickly become smaller as we move left.
This behavior indicates that HC and GHC are better at detecting the sparsest
alternatives with only a very few signals, as those signals would
almost always manifest as the test statistics with the largest magnitude.
In contrast, the plots demonstrate that BJ and GBJ can have more power
to detect weaker, less sparse signals which may be more easily found
by examining the test statistic which is, say, fifth or tenth largest
in magnitude.
The boundaries of HC and GHC can drop below BJ and GBJ again for the smallest
observed magnitudes, but signals would only be found in these observations if they
are particularly dense, a setting which is not the focus of our efforts.
The intuition we can glean from this figure is closely aligned with the
theoretical development of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Donoho and Jin, (<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">2004</a>)</cite> and the simulations

These authors showed that HC is attuned to
detect sparse signals arising at the very tail of the observed
distribution, while BJ has more power as the number of signals rises.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p5.1" class="ltx_p">These results also show why BJ is likely to have low power for detecting sparse signals
when the level of correlation is high.
When 75% of the SNPs are correlated, the rejection boundary for BJ at the largest few observations
is the highest by multiple orders of magnitude on the p-value scale.
It would not be desirable to apply BJ in these types of settings,
as the test loses an extremely large amount of sensitivity to detect
signals in the most outlying values.
BJ is still likely to be suitable for detecting dense signals in these situations.
Here, GBJ acts as a compromise between BJ and GHC under high correlation.
GBJ provides a much lower boundary than BJ at the tail in exchange for slightly
higher boundaries near the middle.
Thus, GBJ can detect both sparse and dense signals in this example.
On the other hand, GBJ provides a slightly higher boundary than GHC at the tail in
exchange for lower boundaries past the tail, so it trades some power in the
extremely sparse regime for more power to detect moderately sparse signals.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S4.p6.1" class="ltx_p">We see that choosing a different statistic is essentially choosing a different boundary-setting
algorithm, and this choice should ideally be informed by parameters such as the amount of
correlation and estimated sparsity level.
Ultimately these plots illustrate that there is no single best global test for all types
of alternatives.
A genome-wide analysis strategy using the omnibus test will be likely to
have robust power across different sparsity settings, correlation
structures, and SNP-set sizes.</p>

the effect of sparsity on power.
Among the non-omnibus tests, we see that GHC and MinP perform well when the number of causal SNPs is low,
as these tests often have the most power in the very sparse regime.
In both panels of Figure <a href="#S5.F2" title="Figure 2 ‣ 5.2 Power of GBJ Under Varying Hypothetical Correlation Structures and Sparsity Settings ‣ 5 Simulation Results ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, the transition to GBJ having
more power than GHC and minP occurs in the moderately sparse regime.
Then as the number of causal SNPs increases into the dense regime,
SKAT begins to catch up and eventually becomes the most powerful test.
This behavior matches our intuition as well as previously published simulation
results.
GHC and minimum p-value place excess weight on the most outlying observations,
so they are well-tuned to detect the very sparse signals.
The rejection region of GBJ is better-suited to find moderately sparse signals, and SKAT is known to perform well
with dense signals.</p>

corresponds to the situation where causal SNPs and non-causal SNPs are correlated
within themselves, but the two groups are independent of each other.
In this case, MinP and GHC become the top-performing tests for a larger range of
sparsity settings, with GBJ losing some of its advantage in the moderately sparse regime.
SKAT has almost no power in these situations, as the signals are sparse and there is
no correlation between causal and non-causal SNPs.
It appears that a large amount of correlation between the non-causal SNPs is
detrimental to the performance of GBJ.
An explanation for this behavior can be found in the rejection region analysis of
Figure <a href="#S4.F1" title="Figure 1 ‣ 4 Rejection Region Analysis of Different SNP-Set Tests ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">1</span></a>.

GBJ is a close second to SKAT under most sparsity settings with these parameters.
SKAT is known to have good performance in the presence of LD between causal SNPs
and noise SNPs, which makes signals appear to be dense.
The increased density of signals also buoys the performance of GBJ compared to
GHC and minimum p-value, which perform the worst under exchangeable correlation.</p>

<p id="S5.SS2.p7.1" class="ltx_p">Never losing too much power compared to the best test, the omnibus test appears to
be robust to LD structure and sparsity.
This behavior is expected as our omnibus approach integrates information from tests which perform well

</div>
<div id="S5.SS2.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.SS2.p8.1" class="ltx_p">GBJ also demonstrates good power in a variety of situations,
and its overall strength and robustness across the entire sparse
regime are attractive properties.
In particular, GBJ is the best-performing test when the
level of sparsity is moderate and there is weak correlation among the noise SNPs.
GBJ is disadvantaged against minP and GHC when signals are extremely sparse or there
is excess correlation among noise SNPs, but it outperforms these tests as signals become more dense.
In contrast, GBJ provides slightly less power than SKAT as signals reach the dense regime or
when there is moderate correlation between causal and non-causal SNPs, but GBJ
is also much more robust than SKAT when signals are sparse and not correlated with
noise SNPs.
Similar to OMNI, GBJ does not fall far behind the best test in any given situation,
which suggests that GBJ is a good choice to use when the signal sparsity is unknown.
Power for the standard BJ is not plotted in the interest of space, but it behaves like a dense test, similar to
SKAT, under correlation.

In a practical setting, we might switch between tests based on certain SNP-set characteristics,

These results do again demonstrate the robustness of GBJ across multiple situations, as
it provides the most power across a large portion of the sparse regime.</p>

but they highlighted FGFR2 as a strong candidate for future studies based on four SNPs in the gene
that showed suggestive association with breast cancer.
Such a situation succinctly illustrates the burden of adjusting for multiple comparisons when
testing individual SNPs.
Gene-level analysis provides an attractive alternative strategy that can reduce the number of
comparisons and also aggregate evidence of signals across multiple SNPs in a gene.
Here we perform a gene-level analysis to study the association between genes and breast cancer risk.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Since individual-level genotype data were available for this study, we first calculated the
marginal test statistics for each SNP using the model in Section <a href="#S2.SS1" title="2.1 Individual-Level Genotype Data ‣ 2 The SNP-Set Testing Framework ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2.1</span></a>.
Specifically, we fit a logistic regression model with four covariates - age and the first three
genotype principal components to control for population structure <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Price et al., <a href="#bib.bib21" title="" class="ltx_ref">2006</a>)</cite>.
Then, for each of 14991 genes, we collected the marginal test statistics for all SNPs located
within the region defined by that gene.
Each gene with more than one marginal SNP test statistic was analyzed with
GBJ, GHC, SKAT, MinP, and the omnibus test.</p>

<div id="S6.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p3.1" class="ltx_p">In Table <a href="#S6.T2" title="Table 2 ‣ 6 Gene-Level Analysis of the CGEMS GWAS Data ‣ Set-Based Tests for Genetic Association Using the Generalized Berk-Jones Statistic" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">2</span></a>, we rank the top ten genes according to the smallest p-value produced by any of the five tests.
In this sample, GBJ provides the strongest evidence of association for the top four genes
and five of the top ten.
Most of these genes are ranked highly by multiple other methods, however no other method provides the
lowest p-value for more than two of the top ten genes.
In fact, GHC and MinP produce the smallest p-value only once between the two of them.
One possible explanation for the underperformance of GHC and MinP is that there may be
multiple tagged SNPs surrounding the true causal loci for each of these genes, which could
create a lack of extremely sparse alternatives.</p>

<div id="S6.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The lowest p-value for any gene over all five tests is produced by testing FGFR2 with GBJ,
supporting the conclusions of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citet">Hunter et al., (<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite>.
Since FGFR2 appears to have signals coming from at least four different SNPs and contains 35 SNPs in total,
it would seem to fall into the category of moderate signal sparsity, where GBJ has good performance.
Thus we may have expected beforehand that GBJ would be the most powerful test for this gene.
FGFR2 has been further validated as a breast cancer associated locus in multiple follow-up studies
<cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Meyer et al., <a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>; Liang et al., <a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">2008</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S6.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Besides FGFR2, genes such as PTCD3 and POLR1A have also been implicated as risk loci in
independent investigations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Boehm et al., <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>; Jia et al., <a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">2011</a>)</cite>.
The overlap of our findings with other studies and other statistics provides a level
of reassurance that GBJ performs well in identifying truly significant genes and not simply
spurious associations.
Alternately, ABCA1 is an example of a gene that may not have received further scrutiny if we
were not utilizing the GBJ test.
ABCA1 expression has been linked with breast cancer risk <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Smith and Land, <a href="#bib.bib22" title="" class="ltx_ref">2012</a>)</cite>, but MinP and GHC
do not provide the same strength of evidence that GBJ does.
It seems likely that there are more than a few signal SNPs in ABCA1, especially since ABCA1
contains a relatively large number of SNPs compared to the other genes in this dataset.</p>

<div id="S6.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S6.p6.1" class="ltx_p">Perhaps due to the limited sample size, no test produces a p-value low enough to be
declared significant after Bonferroni correction for 14991 genes.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We have proposed the Generalized Berk-Jones statistic to test for association
between a SNP-set and an outcome. Our GBJ generalizes the standard
Berk-Jones by modifying the BJ statistic to directly account for the correlation between individual SNPs.
This modification results in a test that is more powerful when SNPs are in LD.
We also provide an analytic p-value calculation for GBJ and generalize it to a class
of supremum-based global tests, allowing valid inference for HC, GHC, BJ, and other
methods when these procedures are applied as SNP-set tests using correlated marginal test statistics.
Rejection region analysis demonstrates that GBJ can be described as
a compromise between Berk-Jones and Higher Criticism-type tests in terms of finite sample performance.</p>

volume past the first few most extreme observations, which lowers power in the moderately sparse regime.
BJ frequently sets the lowest boundary past the tail, but its tail boundary can be orders of magnitude larger than
that of GBJ, HC, and GHC.
Bounds in the expected signal regions must be viewed holistically, so slightly lower
bounds at a few locations are not necessarily desirable if the price is much higher bounds in other signal locations, as
in the case of BJ.
Thus GBJ offers good power to detect moderately sparse effects without losing too much
power when single-SNP signals are extremely sparse.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p3.1" class="ltx_p">Simulation results reinforce the conclusions we find from examining the rejection regions of
GHC and GBJ.
Additionally we see that the MinP test performance is quite good when signals are very sparse,
similar to GHC, but MinP does not perform as well as GHC when signals become more dense.
SKAT has a unique power profile, as it can be particularly powerful when signals
are dense or there is correlation between causal and non-causal SNPs,
but it is also not robust to different correlation structures and will often have very
little power in sparse settings where there is no correlation between causal and non-causal SNPs.
The omnibus test offers robust power across different sparsity levels,
and while it is rarely the best test, it also never has the worst power.
When applied to data from the CGEMS study, we see that GBJ often produces the most
significant p-values, perhaps owing to its versatility across different parameter settings.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p4.1" class="ltx_p">In demonstrating that the BJ statistic can be adapted for increased robustness to correlation,
we have also demonstrated that these types of boundary-defining algorithms can be modified
to increase finite sample power under specific set-level parameters.
It would be of interest to develop different boundary-defining methods that offer more favorable
rejection regions in narrow but well-defined settings.
For example, it may be possible to define tests which outperform GHC or minP over
finer partitions of the extremely sparse regime.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p5.1" class="ltx_p">In a similar vein, it would be interesting to understand the boundary shapes for other previously
proposed boundary algorithms <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Jager and Wellner, <a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">2007</a>)</cite> in the class of Berk-Jones and Higher Criticism.
While many of these algorithms share the same asymptotic guarantees of BJ and HC,
little is known about their comparative finite sample performance, especially when observations in a set are correlated.
These other methods might also have great value in specific settings as mentioned above.
It would additionally be very valuable to develop SNP-set tests that are optimal in certain senses
for arbitrary sparsity and correlation.</p>
</div>
<div id="S7.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S7.p6.1" class="ltx_p">As genomic data collection techniques continue to evolve, it may be necessary to adapt the GBJ as well.
In particular, the rise of whole genome sequencing and fine mapping studies is leading to the discovery of more SNPs
with extremely rare minor alleles.
Marginal test statistics generated from these SNPs are known to be non-Gaussian in finite samples, and thus
they will not have the distribution we assume for GBJ.
GBJ will need to account for null distributions that are not standard normal before SNP-sets
containing rare variants can be tested.</p>
