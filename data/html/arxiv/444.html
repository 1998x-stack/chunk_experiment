<p id="id2.id1" class="ltx_p">The analysis and modelling of a range of plasmas (for example: astrophysical, laser-produced and fusion), require atomic data for a number of parameters, such as energy levels, radiative rates and electron impact excitation rates, or equivalently the effective collision strengths. Such data are desired for a wide range of elements and their many ions, although all elements are not useful for all types of plasmas. Since measurements of atomic data are mostly confined to only a few energy levels of some ions, calculations for all parameters are highly important. However, often there are large discrepancies among different calculations for almost all parameters, which makes it difficult to apply the data with confidence. Many such discrepancies (and the possible remedies) were discussed earlier (<span id="id2.id1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">Fusion Sci. Tech.</span> <span id="id2.id1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">2013</span>, 63, 363). Since then a lot more anomalies for almost all of these atomic parameters have come to notice. Therefore, this paper is a revisit of various atomic parameters to highlight the large discrepancies, their possible sources and some suggestions to avoid those, so that comparatively more accurate and reliable atomic data may be available in the future.</p>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">For the analysis and modelling of plasmas, atomic data for various parameters (including energy levels, radiative rates and electron impact excitation rates, or the effective collision strengths) are required. Measurements of these parameters are mostly confined to only a few energy levels of some ions, and the compiled and assessed results are freely available on the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) website: <span id="S1.p1.1.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://www.nist.gov/pml/data/asd.cfm</span>. Therefore, due to the paucity of experimental results, calculations for all parameters are highly important. During the past few decades a wide range of methods and codes have been developed to calculate the desired data – see for example <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> and references therein. However, often there are large discrepancies among different calculations for almost all parameters, as has already been discussed in detail earlier <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>. Such discrepancies make it difficult for modellers to apply the data with confidence, particularly when neither measurements are available to compare with nor the calculations can be easily repeated to verify the accuracy. Recently, we have noticed that anomalies for almost all of the atomic parameters persist in the literature. Therefore, the <span id="S1.p1.1.2" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">aim</span> of this paper is to revisit the various atomic parameters to highlight the large discrepancies and their possible sources, and to offer some suggestions (again) to avoid these, so that comparatively more accurate and reliable atomic data may be available in the future. We also note here that several efforts have been made in the past by organising workshops on the reliability and accuracy of the atomic data, and suggestions have been made particularly about the ’uncertainty quantifications’ of the data – see for example, the recent paper by Chung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>. However, our emphasis is more on the ‘large discrepancies’, which may propagate through the various stages of a calculation, e.g. from structure to collisions, in ways that are hard to quantify, as noted by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Generally, for applications in astrophysical plasmas (to determine temperature, density and chemical abundance) data are required for ions of lighter elements with Z <math id="S1.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\leq" display="inline"><semantics id="S1.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1b"><leq id="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S1.p2.1.m1.1.1"></leq></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S1.p2.1.m1.1c">\leq</annotation></semantics></math> 30, whereas (particularly) for fusion plasmas similar data are also desired for heavier elements, such as Kr, Xe and W. In particular, tungsten is very important for the developing ITER project as it radiates at almost all ionisation stages. Additionally, atomic data are useful to model for the power loss due to the various impurities present in the reactor walls as well as to control the power generation by a deliberate introduction of these. Since the various atomic parameters have already been defined in our earlier paper <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite>, we straightaway focus on the problems (discrepancies) noted in their determination. We also note here that most of the methods and codes applied in their determination have also been listed in the earlier paper and therefore are not repeated here.</p>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p1.2" class="ltx_p">Calculations for energy levels are generally the easiest to perform and for this reason the literature is full of data for many ions of interest. Availability of measurements for some levels, as stated above, considerably helps in determining the theoretical energies and/or in improving the calculations, because various methodologies (such as optimising orbitals on particular state/level or the use of non-orthogonal or pseudo orbitals) can be applied. However, the problem becomes more difficult when no measurements (and even prior theoretical results) are available for comparisons, as recently experienced for three Cr-like ions: Kr XIII, Tc XX and Xe XXXI <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. For many ions ’configuration interaction’ (CI) among a few hundred levels (or configuration state functions, i.e. CSF) is sufficient to generate reasonably accurate energies (within a few percents), but for some much larger calculations (<math id="S2.p1.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p1.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p1.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p1.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>10<sup id="S2.p1.2.1" class="ltx_sup">9</sup> or more CSFs) are necessary, such as for Cr-like ions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>, <a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p2.4" class="ltx_p">Usually, discrepancies between theory and measurements (or among various calculations) are understandable, and can be resolved by different methodologies as stated above. For example, Turkington et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> reported two sets of theoretical energies for the levels of Na-like W LXIV, for which they used two different atomic structure codes, namely CIV3 and GRASP. Their CIV3 energies differ with those of NIST by up to 4 Ryd for a few levels, because the code does not include two-body relativistic operators and quantum electro-dynamic effects (QED), which are very important for this heavy ion. However, their GRASP energies are comparatively much closer to the measurements, within <math id="S2.p2.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.1.m1.1a"><mo id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.1.m1.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.1.m1.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>1 Ryd. These calculations have been performed with a different purpose in mind, mainly to compare the subsequent scattering data, and therefore the reasons for differences are understandable. However, in a few instances it may not be straightforward. For example, Singh et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite> reported energy levels for 5 Br-like ions with 38 <math id="S2.p2.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\leq" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.2.m2.1a"><mo id="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1" xref="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.2.m2.1b"><leq id="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.2.m2.1.1"></leq></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.2.m2.1c">\leq</annotation></semantics></math> Z <math id="S2.p2.3.m3.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\leq" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.3.m3.1a"><mo id="S2.p2.3.m3.1.1" xref="S2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml">≤</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.3.m3.1b"><leq id="S2.p2.3.m3.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.3.m3.1.1"></leq></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.3.m3.1c">\leq</annotation></semantics></math> 42, for which they adopted the GRASP code with limited CI. However, in a subsequent calculation <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib8" title="" class="ltx_ref">8</a>]</cite> with the same code and CI, it was noted that the calculations of Singh et al. cannot be reproduced for any of the ions considered by them. Although the differences noted were only up to 0.15 Ryd (<math id="S2.p2.4.m4.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p2.4.m4.1a"><mo id="S2.p2.4.m4.1.1" xref="S2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p2.4.m4.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S2.p2.4.m4.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p2.4.m4.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p2.4.m4.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>5%), it undermines the confidence in a calculation – see also section 3 for much larger discrepancies noted for other parameters.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p3.2" class="ltx_p">In any large calculation, particularly when the mixing among levels of the same and/or different configuration(s) is strong, it is very difficult to assign unambiguous designations for all levels – see for example levels of Cl-like Fe IX <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib9" title="" class="ltx_ref">9</a>]</cite>. This is a general atomic structure problem irrespective of the code adopted, and the best one can do is to provide the mixing coefficients so that the users can assign the designation according to their own preferences. It also helps to make comparisons with other calculations. However, in general there are no discrepancies for the <math id="S2.p3.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="J" display="inline"><semantics id="S2.p3.1.m1.1a"><mi id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml">J</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S2.p3.1.m1.1.1">𝐽</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S2.p3.1.m1.1c">J</annotation></semantics></math> values.

Therefore, it often becomes difficult to match a correspondence between the two different labeling schemes, although the GRASP0 code of P. H. Norrington and I. P. Grant (<span id="S2.p3.2.1" class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://amdpp.phys.strath.ac.uk/UK_APAP/codes.html</span>) has this facility. Furthermore, recently a method has been developed by Gaigalas et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib10" title="" class="ltx_ref">10</a>]</cite>, to transform the representation from jj to an approximate LSJ-coupling, and to assign a unique label to all energy levels.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p4.2" class="ltx_p">It is not always possible to verify (or determine) the accuracy of energy levels by performing two (or more) independent calculations with different methods/codes. However, it is always beneficial to have some measurements to compare with and to improve the accuracy of theoretical results – see for example the levels of Si II <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>]</cite> for which the use of non-orthogonal orbitals has been helpful. Another example for which the availability of measurements for a few levels has been very helpful is the case of Cr-like ions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>, <a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. As may be seen in table A of <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib4" title="" class="ltx_ref">4</a>]</cite> differences between the theoretical and experimental energies for the levels of Co IV are up to 35%, and the orderings are also different. This is in spite of using very large CI (with up to 76 138 CSFs), and with two different codes, namely GRASP and FAC. For this (and other similar) ion(s) it became necessary to consider over a 1000 configurations, for both the even and odd levels, which generated more than a billion CSFs. However, in any atomic structure calculation (code) it becomes difficult to handle such a large number of CSFs and therefore, we adopted the quasi-relativistic Hartree-Fock (QRHF) code of Bogdanovich and Rancova <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib13" title="" class="ltx_ref">13</a>]</cite>, in which a reduction process was applied to scan and select the most important ones, based on their weights. This process reduced the number of CSFs to under a million for both the even and odd levels, but brought the discrepancies between theory and measurements below 3% for the levels of the 3d<sup id="S2.p4.2.1" class="ltx_sup">6</sup> configuration, and below 1% for the higher ones, i.e. (3d<sup id="S2.p4.2.2" class="ltx_sup">5</sup>) 4s and 4p.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S2.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Another code which has been successfully applied with very large CI is the revised version of GRASP known as GRASP2K <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite> – see the work of Jönsson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite> for B-like ions, of Froese Fischer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite> for W XL, and the recent work of Gustafson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> for Mg-like iron. In all such cases the theoretical results are very close to the available measurements. This reinforces our earlier conclusion <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib1" title="" class="ltx_ref">1</a>]</cite> that all codes are not useful for all applications, significant discrepancies between theory and measurements should not be ignored, and the choice of a code is very important and should be based on: (i) the ion concerned, (ii) the accuracy desired, and (iii) the application in mind. Furthermore, what configurations to include in a calculation is equally important, and should be based on a fair balance of even and odd CSFs as deliberated by Froese Fischer <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib17" title="" class="ltx_ref">17</a>]</cite>, and their energy ranges as emphasised by us <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.</p>

However, their results could not be reproduced with the same version of the GRASP code and with the same configurations adopted by them, and their results differed from our work [8] by up to five orders of magnitude, and for all ions. The calculations are simple as only limited CI was used. The easiest way to understand such large discrepancies is to compare the input data between their and our calculations, but we were not able to obtain the data from the authors.
Similarly, discrepancies in the reported A-values for W XL and W LVIII by S. Aggarwal et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib23" title="" class="ltx_ref">23</a>]</cite> and Mohan et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib24" title="" class="ltx_ref">24</a>]</cite>, respectively, are up to four orders of magnitude for several transitions, as demonstrated by us <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>, <a href="#bib.bib20" title="" class="ltx_ref">20</a>]</cite>.

This was due to random selection of A-values by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib41" title="" class="ltx_ref">41</a>]</cite> in the determination of <math id="S3.p6.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\tau" display="inline"><semantics id="S3.p6.5.m5.1a"><mi id="S3.p6.5.m5.1.1" xref="S3.p6.5.m5.1.1.cmml">τ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S3.p6.5.m5.1b"><ci id="S3.p6.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S3.p6.5.m5.1.1">𝜏</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S3.p6.5.m5.1c">\tau</annotation></semantics></math> as explained by us <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib42" title="" class="ltx_ref">42</a>]</cite>. Finally, similar discrepancies and for the same randomness reason have been noted for the levels of W LXVI – see <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib43" title="" class="ltx_ref">43</a>]</cite> and <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib44" title="" class="ltx_ref">44</a>]</cite>. In conclusion, such situations create unnecessary problems for the users and/or assessors of atomic data as without performing an independent calculation results cannot be taken at the face value. Therefore as for energy levels, multiple calculations for A-values and preferably by differing methodologies are always useful to resolve large discrepancies and to have confidence in the applied data. This point has also been emphasised by Chung et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib2" title="" class="ltx_ref">2</a>]</cite>, and has most successfully been implemented by Wang et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib45" title="" class="ltx_ref">45</a>, <a href="#bib.bib46" title="" class="ltx_ref">46</a>, <a href="#bib.bib47" title="" class="ltx_ref">47</a>]</cite> and Si et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib48" title="" class="ltx_ref">48</a>]</cite> for a series of ions. They have performed systematic calculations with the MCDF and MBPT methods to determine the energy levels and A-values to spectroscopic accuracy. However, for this kind of work very large calculations need to be performed for which Jönsson et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib49" title="" class="ltx_ref">49</a>]</cite> have suggested further modifications to the GRASP2K code. Similarly, Safronova et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib50" title="" class="ltx_ref">50</a>, <a href="#bib.bib51" title="" class="ltx_ref">51</a>]</cite> have performed very accurate (and large) calculations for a series of ions, using the CI+MBPT codes, and with single, double and triple excitations of electrons.</p>

Additionally, for each ion two panels are shown, one (a) for transitions <span id="S4.p7.8.4" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">from</span> the lower (I) and the other (b) <span id="S4.p7.8.5" class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic">to</span> upper levels (J). This is because sometimes they reveal different (i.e. more specific) conclusions. Finally, for brevity and clarity only those transitions are shown which differ by over 20%.</p>

For this ion the reasoning of a larger model given by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib62" title="" class="ltx_ref">62</a>]</cite> and shown in their fig. 2 appears to be plausible. However, even for the transitions in C III for which our calculations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite> included a considerably larger number of levels (166), the discrepancies are large as shown in Fig. 2. In fact, for transitions only among the lowest 20 levels there is a satisfactory agreement between the two calculations – see Fig. 2(b). Therefore, the differences seen here do not appear to be because of a larger model included by <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. This is further confirmed by Fig. 3 for the transitions of N IV for which both calculations include exactly the same number of levels (and from the same configurations), but the satisfactory agreement is only for transitions among the lowest <math id="S4.p8.5.m5.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\sim" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.p8.5.m5.1a"><mo id="S4.p8.5.m5.1.1" xref="S4.p8.5.m5.1.1.cmml">∼</mo><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.p8.5.m5.1b"><csymbol cd="latexml" id="S4.p8.5.m5.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.p8.5.m5.1.1">similar-to</csymbol></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.p8.5.m5.1c">\sim</annotation></semantics></math>30 levels. Furthermore, these differences (discrepancies) increase with increasing temperature as discussed and demonstrated in our earlier papers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>, <a href="#bib.bib33" title="" class="ltx_ref">33</a>, <a href="#bib.bib61" title="" class="ltx_ref">61</a>]</cite>.

In a majority of cases it is difficult to assess the accuracy of the published data without performing independent calculations, either with the same (or similar) or a different method. Unfortunately, it is not always possible because enough computational resources or expertise may not be available. More importantly, calculations for <math id="S5.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Upsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p1.2.m2.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml">Υ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p1.2.m2.1.1">Υ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p1.2.m2.1c">\Upsilon</annotation></semantics></math> are particularly very computationally intensive for which large resources and months (if not years) of (computational) time are required. Since more and more levels are now being included in the scattering calculations, it is almost impossible to reproduce and verify the reported data with another similar work. Therefore, it is necessary for the producers of atomic data not to make the mistakes in the first place, and to make as many comparisons as possible. A limited comparison (as discussed for the transitions of Mg V) may lead to wrong conclusions, and subsequently to incorrect results.</p>

For example, up to what value of partial waves the calculations for <math id="S5.p4.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Omega" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p4.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.p4.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Ω</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p4.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p4.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p4.1.m1.1.1">Ω</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p4.1.m1.1c">\Omega</annotation></semantics></math> should be performed strongly depends on the energy, otherwise the results may be under/over estimated as discussed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib56" title="" class="ltx_ref">56</a>, <a href="#bib.bib78" title="" class="ltx_ref">78</a>, <a href="#bib.bib79" title="" class="ltx_ref">79</a>]</cite>.

Finally, very large calculations (involving hundreds of levels) for any ion should only be performed when absolutely necessary. This is because the chances of errors in such calculations are more and these cannot be easily reproduced for verification and/or assessment.</p>

<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S5.p5.4" class="ltx_p">It is encouraging to note that some efforts have already been made to resolve discrepancies in <math id="S5.p5.1.m1.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Upsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p5.1.m1.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.p5.1.m1.1.1" xref="S5.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml">Υ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p5.1.m1.1b"><ci id="S5.p5.1.m1.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.1.m1.1.1">Υ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p5.1.m1.1c">\Upsilon</annotation></semantics></math> data. For example, very recently Fernández-Menchero et al. <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib80" title="" class="ltx_ref">80</a>]</cite> have performed yet another calculation for N IV by adopting the BSR (B-spline R-matrix) method. They have also highlighted a few reasons for the (possible) inaccuracies in the ICFT calculations, particularly for the weak spin changing transitions. Another point which we have repeatedly emphasised is the limited range of energy often adopted in the ICFT calculations but extrapolated to a very large extent in order to calculate <math id="S5.p5.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Upsilon" display="inline"><semantics id="S5.p5.2.m2.1a"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml">Υ</mi><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1b"><ci id="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S5.p5.2.m2.1.1">Υ</ci></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S5.p5.2.m2.1c">\Upsilon</annotation></semantics></math> up to very high temperatures.
