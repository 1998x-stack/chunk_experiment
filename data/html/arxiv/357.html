<p id="id1.id1" class="ltx_p">We present non-overlapping Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM) based on quasi-optimal transmission operators for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems with piece-wise constant material properties. The quasi-optimal transmission boundary conditions incorporate readily available approximations of Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators. These approximations consist of either complexified hypersingular boundary integral operators for the Helmholtz equation or square root Fourier multipliers with complex wavenumbers. We show that under certain regularity assumptions on the closed interface of material discontinuity, the DDM with quasi-optimal transmission conditions are well-posed. We present a DDM framework based on Robin-to-Robin (RtR) operators that can be computed robustly via boundary integral formulations. More importantly, the use of quasi-optimal transmission operators results in DDM that converge in small numbers of iterations even in the challenging high-contrast, high-frequency regime of Helmholtz transmission problems. Furthermore, the DDM presented in this text require only minor modifications to handle the case of transmission problems in partially coated domains, while still maintaining excellent convergence properties. We also investigate the dependence of the DDM iterative performance on the number of subdomains.

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p1.1" class="ltx_p">The phenomenon of electromagnetic wave scattering by bounded penetrable objects with constant electric permittivities is relevant for numerous applications in antenna design, diffraction gratings, to name but a few. Numerical methods based on Boundary Integral Equations (BIE) are well-suited for simulation of these types of applications owing to the dimension reduction, explicit enforcement of radiation conditions, and lack of numerical dispersion that they enjoy. There is a wide array of well-conditioned BIE of the second kind for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems, see references <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite> for in-depth discussions. These formulations rely on regularization techniques that incorporate readily available approximations of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operators. Nevertheless, these formulations require relative large numbers of Krylov subspace iterations for convergence in the high-contrast, high-frequency regime. This situation can be attributed to the lack of easily computable approximations of DtN operators for bounded domains <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib6" title="" class="ltx_ref">6</a>]</cite>. Furthermore, the regularization strategy becomes cumbersome in the case of more complicated material properties, e.g., perfectly conducting coatings, multiple junctions. A different alternative is to resort to matrix compression techniques to produce direct solvers for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems in the computationally challenging high-contrast, high-frequency regime <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite>. However, the direct solvers proposed in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib18" title="" class="ltx_ref">18</a>]</cite> require large memory consumption and are difficult to parallelize.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p2.1" class="ltx_p">Domain Decomposition Methods (DDM) are natural candidates for the solution of scattering problems involving composite scatterers. DDM are divide-and-conquer strategies whereby the computational domain is divided into smaller subdomains for which solutions are matched via transmission conditions on subdomain interfaces. The convergence of DDM for time-harmonic wave scattering applications depends a great deal on the choice of the transmission conditions that allow the exchange of information between adjacent subdomains. These interface transmission conditions should ideally allow information to flow out of a subdomain with as little as possible information being reflected back into the subdomain. Thus, the interface transmission conditions fall into the category of Absorbing Boundary Conditions (ABC). From this perspective, the ideal choice of transmission conditions on an interface between two subdomains is such that the impedance/transmission operator is the restriction to the common interface of the DtN operator corresponding to the adjacent subdomain. Traditionally, the interface transmission conditions were chosen as the classical first order ABC outgoing Robin/impedance boundary conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. The convergence of DDM with classical Robin interface boundary conditions is slow and is adversely affected by the number of subdomains. Fortunately, the convergence of DDM can be considerably improved through incorporation of ABC that constitute higher order approximations of DtN operators in the form of second order approximations with optimized tangential derivative coefficients <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib14" title="" class="ltx_ref">14</a>]</cite>, square root approximations <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>, or other types of non-local transmission conditions <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>, <a href="#bib.bib26" title="" class="ltx_ref">26</a>]</cite>. Alternatively, so-called Perfectly Matched Layers can be used at subdomain interfaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib27" title="" class="ltx_ref">27</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p3.1" class="ltx_p">We devote our attention to DDM for Helmholtz transmission problems that use transmission operators given by approximations of DtN operators in the form of either (a) hypersingular Helmholtz BIO, (b) square root Fourier multipliers, and (c) scalar multiples of identity operators. A fundamental requirement in DDM is that the subdomain Helmholtz problems with Robin/impedance boundary conditions that incorporate the aforementioned transmission operators are well posed. This entails the complexification of the wavenumbers in the definition of the three types of transmission operators considered above; this modification ensures that the transmission operators enjoy certain coercivity property that suffices for the well posedness of subdomain Helmholtz problems with Robin boundary conditions. In practice, these complex wavenumbers in the definition of the transmission operators are chosen to optimize the rate of convergence of the ensuing DDM in the case of simple geometries (e.g circles, infinite waveguides) amenable to analytical modal analysis <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. A judicious choice of the complex wavenumbers in the definition of transmission operators gives rise to DDM whose rate of convergence is virtually independent of frequency; for this reason the transmission operators described above with appropriate complex wavenumbers are referred to as quasi-optimal transmission operators <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib3" title="" class="ltx_ref">3</a>]</cite>. The DDM can be easily recast in operator form using certain subdomain Robin-to-Robin (RtR) operators that map outgoing Robin data to incoming Robin data defined in terms of transmission operators. In the case when the transmission operators correspond to the classical first order ABC, the ensuing RtR operators turn out to be unitary, a key ingredient in establishing the well posedness of DDM <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib11" title="" class="ltx_ref">11</a>, <a href="#bib.bib15" title="" class="ltx_ref">15</a>]</cite>. However, the transmission operators of type (a), (b), and (c) considered above do not give rise to unitary RtR maps, and the wellposedness of the ensuing DDM is more complicated. Nevertheless, we investigate in more detail the RtR operators by expressing them in terms of Boundary Integral Operators (BIO), and we are able to establish the well posedness of DDM for Helmholtz transmission problems with one closed interface of discontinuity under various assumptions on the regularity of that interface.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p4.1" class="ltx_p">The key computational ingredient in the implementation of DDM is the computation of subdomain RtR maps. We provide several robust representations of RtR maps in terms of BIOs and their inverses. We present high-order discretizations of the RtR operators based on Nyström discretizations of the BIO that enter in their representations. We provide ample evidence that the DDM based on the quasi-optimal transmission operators considered in this text give rise to small numbers of Krylov subspace iterations for Helmholtz transmission problems in the high-frequency, high-contrast regime. Furthermore, these numbers of iterations depend very mildly on the frequency, which is in stark contrast with solvers based on BIE <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>]</cite>. Nevertheless, the computation of RtR maps becomes more problematic in the high-frequency regime, where matrices of large size need be inverted. Thus, it is customary to resort to divide the penetrable scatterer in a collection of non-overlapping subdomains and formulate a DDM that takes these further subdivisions into account. In particular, the quasi-optimal transmission operators need be restricted to subdomain interfaces that are open arcs. This is slighly delicate, given that those operators are global operators, i.e. their definition requires an integration boundary that is a closed curve. These restrictions can be effected by localizations via smooth cut-off functions supported on subdomain interfaces <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. This strategy allows for an extension of DDM with quasi-optimal transmission operators in the presence of cross points between subdomains, i.e. points where three or more domains with different material properties meet. In particular, we can use the cut-off methodology to formulate DDM with quasi-optimal transmission operator for the case of transmission problems in partially coated domains. Again, the DDM that incorporate quasi-optimal transmission operators perform well in terms of numbers of iterations in the case of penetrable scatterers that are partially coated.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p id="S1.p5.1" class="ltx_p">Although the use of quasi-optimal transmission operators, as those recounted above, accelerates a great deal the convergence of DDM, the number of iterations required for convergence still grows with the number of subdomains. This is not entirely surprising since the transmission operators are chosen to optimize the local exchange of information between adjacent subdomains, and affect to a lesser degree the global exchange of information between distant subdomains. Recent efforts have been directed to construct “double sweep”-type preconditioners that address the latter issue <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib30" title="" class="ltx_ref">30</a>, <a href="#bib.bib32" title="" class="ltx_ref">32</a>]</cite>. The resulting preconditioned DDM scale favorably with frequency and number of subdomains, but appear to be somewhat less effective for wave propagation problems in composite media that exhibit sharp high-contrast interfaces. The incorporation of DDM preconditioners is currently underway.</p>

In the high-frequency regime, the computation of the RtR maps requires inversion of large matrices, which becomes expensive if direct linear algebra solvers are employed. Furthermore, iterative Krylov subspace solvers require increasingly larger numbers of iterations for computation of interior RtR maps as the frequency increases, regardless of the BIE formulation used for these computations. Thus, one possibility to reduce the computational costs incurred by the computation of RtR maps is to further subdivide the interior domain into a union of non-overlapping subdomains <math id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\Omega_{1}=\cup_{j=1}^{J}\Omega_{1j}" display="inline"><semantics id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1a"><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml"><msub id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml">Ω</mi><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml">1</mn></msub><mo rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml">=</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml"><msubsup id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml"><mo lspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.2.cmml">∪</mo><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.cmml"><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.cmml">j</mi><mo id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.1.cmml">=</mo><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.3.cmml">1</mn></mrow><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.3.cmml">J</mi></msubsup><msub id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml"><mi mathvariant="normal" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.2.cmml">Ω</mi><mrow id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.cmml"><mn id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.2" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.2.cmml">1</mn><mo lspace="0em" rspace="0em" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.1" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.1.cmml">​</mo><mi id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.3" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.3.cmml">j</mi></mrow></msub></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1b"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1"><eq id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.1"></eq><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.2">Ω</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.2.3">1</cn></apply><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3"><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1">superscript</csymbol><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1">subscript</csymbol><union id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.2"></union><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3"><eq id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.1"></eq><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.2">𝑗</ci><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.2.3.3">1</cn></apply></apply><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.1.3">𝐽</ci></apply><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2"><csymbol cd="ambiguous" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2">subscript</csymbol><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.2">Ω</ci><apply id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3"><times id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.1.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.1"></times><cn type="integer" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.2.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.2">1</cn><ci id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.3.cmml" xref="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1.1.3.2.3.3">𝑗</ci></apply></apply></apply></apply></annotation-xml><annotation encoding="application/x-tex" id="S4.SS3.p1.2.m2.1c">\Omega_{1}=\cup_{j=1}^{J}\Omega_{1j}</annotation></semantics></math>.

<p id="S6.p1.5" class="ltx_p">We use Nyström discretizations of the CFIESK equation (<a href="#S5.E3" title="In 5.1 Boundary integral equation formulations ‣ 5 Scalar transmission problems in partially coated domains ‣ Domain Decomposition Methods based on quasi-optimal transmission operators for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>), as well as the RtR maps associated with the various DDM formulations. The key ingredient is the Nyström discretization of the four BIO in the Calderón calculus for piecewise smooth boundaries. These discretizations were introduced in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>]</cite> where this methodology was presented in full detail. In particular, the discretization of the CFIESK equation (<a href="#S5.E3" title="In 5.1 Boundary integral equation formulations ‣ 5 Scalar transmission problems in partially coated domains ‣ Domain Decomposition Methods based on quasi-optimal transmission operators for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5.3</span></a>) was described in the aforementioned contribution. Therefore, we present here the discretization of the DDM formulations that relies, in turn, on discretizations of the corresponding RtR maps.

Based on these, the DDM algorithm proceeds with a precomputational stage whereby matrix approximations of all the RtR maps needed are produced. The precomputational stage is computationally expensive on account of the matrix inversions needed for the computation of discrete RtR matrices. Nevertheless, this stage is highly parallelizable since the computation of the RtR matrix corresponding to a subdomain does not require information from adjacent subdomains.

<p id="S7.p1.1" class="ltx_p">In this section we present numerical experiments concerning the iterative behavior of various DDM solvers considered in this text. We also document the iterative behavior of the CFIESK solvers. We mention that a comprehensive comparison between various integral formulations for transmission problems was pursued in <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib5" title="" class="ltx_ref">5</a>, <a href="#bib.bib12" title="" class="ltx_ref">12</a>, <a href="#bib.bib19" title="" class="ltx_ref">19</a>]</cite>. While the CFIESK formulations are not the most performant formulations vis-a-vis iterative solvers, they are the simplest and most widely used in the collocation discretization community <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib25" title="" class="ltx_ref">25</a>, <a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>]</cite>. Also, and as mentioned previously, the CFIESK can be relatively easily extended to more complex boundary conditions scenarios. It is not our goal to carry in this text a detailed computational efficiency comparison between BIE formulations and DDM formulations of Helmholtz transmission problems. On the one hand, there is a relatively large body of work in which fast methods and matrix compression techniques are used to accelerate the performance of BIE based solvers <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_cite">[<a href="#bib.bib16" title="" class="ltx_ref">16</a>, <a href="#bib.bib7" title="" class="ltx_ref">7</a>]</cite>. On the other hand, DDM with quasi-optimal transmission operators for transmission Helmholtz equations have been studied to a very limited extent; it is our intent to highlight in this paper the remarkable iterative properties that these solvers enjoy, and to point out several challenges that they face related to efficient computations of RtR maps. It is important to bear in mind that one of the main attractive feature of DDM is their embarassing parallelism, which is much harder to achieve by BIE solvers. We plan to pursue elsewhere an in depth comparison between the computational efficiency of BIE solvers and DDM solvers for three dimensional transmission problems.</p>

However, as shown in Figure <a href="#S7.F5" title="Figure 5 ‣ 7 Numerical results ‣ Domain Decomposition Methods based on quasi-optimal transmission operators for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems" class="ltx_ref"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">5</span></a>, the numbers of iterations grow considerally with the number of subdomains, albeit the computation of RtR maps becomes much more efficient since the electric size of interior subdomains has been decreased. This increase of number of iterations as the number of subdomains increases and the adjacency graph becomes more complex can be attributed to the global communication flow between subdomains, regardless of choice of transmission operators.

Thus, even though the exchange of information between adjacent subdomains can be optimized, the number of DDM iterations does not scale with the number of subdomains, and preconditioners are needed to stabilize this phenomenon.

<div id="S8.p1" class="ltx_para ltx_noindent">
<p id="S8.p1.1" class="ltx_p">We presented analysis and numerical experiments concerning DDM based on quasi-optimal transmission operators for the solution of Helmholtz transmission problems in two dimensions. The quasi-optimal transmission operators that we used are readily computable approximations of DtN operators. Under certain assumptions on the regularity of the of the (closed) boundary of material discontinuity we established the well posedness of the DDM with the transmission operators considered. We provided ample numerical evidence that the incorporation of quasi-optimal transmission operators within DDM gives rise to small numbers of Krylov subspace iterations for convergence that depend very mildly on the frequency or contrast. However, the numers of iterations do not scale with the number of subdomains involved in the DDM. Extensions to three-dimensional configurations are currently underway.</p>
