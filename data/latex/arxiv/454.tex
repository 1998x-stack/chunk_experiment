\begin{abstract}
The problem of radar detection in compound Gaussian clutter when
a radar signature is not completely known has not been considered yet and
is addressed in this paper.
We proposed a robust technique
to detect, based on the generalized likelihood ratio test, a point-like target 
embedded in compound Gaussian clutter.
Employing an array of antennas, we assume that
the actual steering vector departs from 
the nominal one, but lies in a known interval.
The detection is then secured by employing a semi-deﬁnite
programming.
It is confirmed via simulation that the proposed detector
experiences a negligible detection
loss compared to an adaptive normalized matched filter in a perfectly matched case,
 but outperforms in cases of mismatched signal.
 Remarkably, the proposed detector possesses constant false alarm rate with
respect to the clutter covariance matrix.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has addressed the problem of detecting a mismatched signal embedded in compound Gaussian noise.
Specifically, phase shifting of the actual steering vector departs from that of the nominal one but
belongs to a known interval.
The proposed detector is shown to be more robust to mismatched signals than the adaptive NMF,
and even achieves reasonable detection probabilities when the signal to detect lying out of the designed interval.
 Remarkably, the $\theta$-MLE detector has CFAR w.r.t all statistic of noise.
%  but $\theta$-SCM do not have CFAR w.r.t \textit{texture} distribution.
%However, $\theta$-SCM requires less computation than $\theta$-MLE.
 A drawback of the proposed detector is that the likelihood ratio has no explicit form, for which
 it is difficult to gain a deeper insight into the performance of the detector.
Another drawback is the complexity associated with the SDP.
Though proposed scheme can detect a seriously mismatched signal, it does not include
effects of possible interference, which might be a topic for a further research.
