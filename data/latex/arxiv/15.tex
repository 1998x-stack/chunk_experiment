\label{sec:Conclusion}

For future extreme-scale HPC systems, designers will be required to work within tight constraints of cost, power and reliability to achieve greater performance. The use of design patterns enables the exploration of alternative solutions for a specific context and provides a framework to combine individual patterns into complete solutions.  
The performance and reliability models for resilience design patterns presented in this paper allow us to develop measures to analyze the solutions built using the patterns. 
While these models for the architecture patterns are not detailed enough and refining them will lead to considerable added complexity, they predict the implications of selecting specific combination of patterns for the reliability and performance of a system in a given context.   
The models developed in this paper are designed to be useful for simulation frameworks to examine the effectiveness of a resilience solution for specific fault models and fault rates, as well as to measure the performance and reliability characteristics of the pattern-based solution for different system architectures, software environments and application workloads.
